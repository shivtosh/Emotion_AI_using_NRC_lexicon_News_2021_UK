0," Covid: UK cases fall for seventh day in a row By Jennifer Meierhans & Lauren TurnerBBC News This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says people should ""remain very cautious"" The daily number of Covid cases recorded in the UK has fallen for a seventh day in a row, to 23,511.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier urged people to ""remain cautious"" and not jump to ""premature conclusions"" about the falling numbers. There were also a further 131 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test, the highest number since March. Public Health England said this showed the pandemic was ""not over yet"" and urged people to still take precautions. Its medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said people should get both vaccine doses, meet outside, isolate if told to by NHS Test and Trace and limit contacts. She said the number of deaths was ""in part due to the high number of cases recorded in recent weeks"", with the latest figures highlighting ""we are still in the third wave"".  The cases figure is a fall of 23,047 from Tuesday last week, when there were 46,588 new cases.  Mr Johnson, speaking before the latest figures were released, said: ""It's very, very important that we don't allow ourselves to run away with premature conclusions about this. ""Step four of the opening-up only took place a few days ago. People have got to remain very cautious, and that remains the approach of the government."" Mr Johnson, who was at Surrey Police HQ in Guildford on his first visit after self-isolating for 10 days, acknowledged frustration over the vast number of people being pinged by the NHS app and being told to quarantine.  ""I totally understand that, particularly now as we're starting to see some better figures,"" he said. ""But I think everybody understands that this is still a very dangerous disease. ""We do need to use the tools that we have. Self-isolation is the one that we've got. I urge people to do it."" The new test-to-release system will come in on 16 August but ""until then, please could everybody stick with the programme"", Mr Johnson said.  The prime minister declined to confirm or deny reports that students might be required to prove their vaccination status to attend lectures or stay in halls of residence, saying: ""Young people are doing an incredible job of coming forward to get vaccinations."" Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said that those who refuse a vaccine are ""selfish"" and warned they will be barred from some events. The UK government is considering the use of vaccine passports for some large scale events, such as football matches, having already announced they will be required for nightclub entry in England from the end of September. 'Too early to tell' Earlier, epidemiologist Prof Neil Ferguson, who previously said 100,000 Covid cases a day was ""almost inevitable"" after England's unlocking on 19 July said: ""The effect of vaccines is hugely reducing the risk of hospitalisations and death.  ""And I'm positive that by late September or October time we will be looking back at most of the pandemic.""  Prof Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said it was ""too early to tell"" if Covid cases would now reach 100,000 a day, but he was ""happy to be wrong - if it's wrong in the right direction"". He added: ""We're not completely out of the woods, but the equation has fundamentally changed.""  The number of patients in hospital with Covid-19 is still rising - although at a slower rate than during previous waves because of the impact of vaccinations.  The latest data showed there were 5,918 people in hospital on Monday, compared with 4,615 the previous Monday. And the most recent figure available for admissions to hospital, from 22 July, showed 945 were admitted that day.  In Northern Ireland, the chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride said the health service was operating under ""huge pressures"" as Covid admissions rose and more health trusts cancelled surgeries. After critics branded the decision to continue easing restrictions as dangerous and unethical, you could be forgiven for expecting the prime minister to be more celebratory about the turnaround in infection rates. Instead, there have been largely words of caution. That reflects the fact that this wave of infection is finely balanced. Yes - it appears to have been brought under control before it got to some of the levels experts were warning about just over a week ago. But that is because of two core factors: the levels of immunity in the population and how much mixing the public is doing. Prior to the 19 July easing the amount of contact we had with others was still at under half the level it was before the pandemic hit. If that goes up, it could be enough to tip the balance and send infections back upwards. Ministers have been told by scientists advising them that the key is now vigilance as we are likely to be in a period where infection rates bobble around - a sustained period of mini-peaks that need to be carefully managed. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, has said it was part of ""our collective civil duty"" to get vaccinated.  She accused those who deliberately spread misinformation about the vaccine of ""anti-social behaviour"", saying they were ""putting people at risk"".  ""I'm not going to criticise people who have genuine concerns, but I will not stop trying to encourage you to educate yourself about the vaccine and come forward and get vaccinated,"" she said.  The Scottish government's national clinical director has said the country's case rate is ""dramatically falling"". Professor Jason Leitch told the Today programme that Scotland once had the highest case numbers in five out of the top 10 local authorities in the UK, but now has none in the top 150. He said: ""We've now seen hospitalisations fall. Around 3% of positive people get admitted to hospital but they are now younger, relatively healthy and discharged quicker. But some stay, and we've had many deaths over the last few days."" He added that the Scotland-England Euro 2020 match had caused a spike in cases due to fans travelling.

 Details This report summarises 4 case studies with a maintained school, a single academy trust (SAT) and 2 multi-academy trusts (MATs). The main priorities for governors and trusts in the next year include ensuring that students have access to the full learning experience, helping them recover academically and socially, ensuring stable leadership and restoring and improving staff and pupil wellbeing. Governing bodies are likely to move to a hybrid model of online and face-to-face meetings in the future. Face-to-face meetings are seen as vital for developing strategy whereas online meetings are more efficient and allow for greater inclusion. Explore the topic Is this page useful?

3," Covid passports ‘right’ for Premier League matches, says Michael Gove Senior minister says unjabbed fans who attend matches are selfish and could be barred in future Michael Gove has given the strongest hint yet that domestic Covid passports will be needed for fans attending Premier League matches, as he branded those who refuse to get jabbed “selfish”. The government has already announced that proof of inoculation will be required in nightclubs in England from the end of September, but the Cabinet Office minister went one step further as the number of infections continued to decline but deaths rose to their highest level since mid-March. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson said case numbers were getting “better” but cautioned they could rise significantly again as the effects begin to be felt of his decision, which came into force on Monday, to lift most legal restrictions across England. Despite recent warnings that the number of people catching Covid could hit 100,000 a day, the figure appeared to have plateaued at 54,674 on 17 July. It has more than halved since then, with cases down to 23,511 on Tuesday. Some scientists have been left surprised, with reasons attributed to the decline including the end of the European football championship, the heatwave encouraging more people to socialise outside, England’s schools breaking up for summer and the vaccine rollout. But the number of people with Covid in hospital is still rising and stands at 5,918, while the number of daily deaths grew to 131 – the highest since 17 March, when the country was still in lockdown. Gove said domestic Covid passports were “the right way to go” for some venues so “people can be confident that those who are attending those events are less likely to be carriers of the virus” – and specifically cited Premier League matches. He said that if businesses “required a certain level of safety” from customers, then people who remain unvaccinated by choice should not be surprised if they were “barred” – accusing them of “putting other people’s health and lives at risk”. Johnson earlier urged people not to “run away with premature conclusions” about the dip in Covid cases and said more young people getting jabbed would “help us all to move forward”. In a move likely to inflame an already-growing row among Tory MPs about the use of documents that essentially mandate vaccination in some settings, the prime minister did not rule out certification being needed for university students to attend lectures from next term His urge for caution was echoed by Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling spurred the government into action at the start of the Covid pandemic, who warned the UK was not “out of the woods yet”. He said it would be several weeks before the effect of almost total unlocking was felt, although he admitted “the equation has fundamentally changed” as a result of vaccines “hugely reducing the risk of hospitalisations and death”. “I’m positive that by late September or October time we will be looking back at most of the pandemic,” said Ferguson, who sits on the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). “We will have Covid with us, we will still have people dying from Covid, but we’ll have put the bulk of the pandemic behind us. “Clearly the higher we can get vaccination coverage, the better – that will protect people and reduce transmission – but there is going to be remaining uncertainty until the autumn.” But there were warnings that the strain on the NHS was showing no sign of abating. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said the pressure on hospital, community, mental health and administration services “feels as great as it did in January”. About 15,000 of 100,000 NHS beds had been lost because of measures to reduce transmission in patients, and the NHS was still doing “a whole bunch of different things at once” and “trying to recover all of those care backlogs at full pelt”, he told Sky News. Hopson said there was also “record demand for urgent care” with “large numbers of staff self-isolating”, and more off with stress and other mental health conditions.

Detail of outcome Having considered the responses to the consultation and assessed the current situation, the Lord Chancellor has taken the decision to endorse - on a short-term, timebound basis - a flexible approach (known as ‘temporary operating arrangements’) that supports Resident Judges who wish to: These measures are temporary and timebound. They will come to an end six months after any court chooses to implement them and we will carefully monitor their impact. It is one measure in the suite of recovery activity (such as remote hearings) available to Resident Judges as an option should they want to use it, and will not be mandated across courts and tribunals. Any use of these models is at the discretion of the local judiciary and should follow careful discussion and consideration with local court users, including legal practitioners. Original consultation Summary 
          Seeking views on COVID operating hours as part of wider COVID-19 recovery plans in the Crown Court. The consultation closed at 11:45pm on 14 December 2020.

           This consultation ran from5pm on 27 November 2020 to
        11:45pm on 14 December 2020
 Consultation description As part of HMCTS’ Crime Recovery Plan, one of the four pillars to recovery is to further maximise the use of our existing estate through opening our buildings for longer during coronavirus (COVID-19). The pandemic and its necessary countermeasures are an unprecedented challenge to the courts and tribunals which merits an unprecedented response. COVID operating hours (COH) were piloted in seven Crown Court centres to test whether we could do more in the limited space we have to support recovery. The pilots were unrelated to previous pilots which have tested extended and flexible operating hours in the civil and family courts. They were purposefully designed to respond to the impacts of COVID-19, and to be a temporary response to increase capacity. Following the pilots of COH at Crown Court locations around the country, assessment data was collected from each site to assess the impacts of COH and how effectively the pilots met the aim of increasing capacity to reduce backlogs. HMCTS then undertook a short, targeted consultation with the legal professions on the key findings from the assessment of the pilot sites and a proposal to widen the use of COH across more Crown court centres.

5," Britain reports highest deaths from COVID-19 since March as Johnson urges caution A sign asking customers to wear protective face masks is seen in the window of a shop on Oxford Street, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in London, Britain, July 26, 2021. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Britain reported its highest number of deaths and people in hospital with coronavirus since March on Tuesday, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson urging caution despite a week of lower reported numbers of infection. Britain reported 131 new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily total since March 17, though it came after just 14 deaths were reported on Monday, suggesting the weekend might have impacted when deaths were reported. The number of COVID-19 patients in British hospitals has also steadily risen to 5,918, also the highest since March, following a spike in cases earlier this month. The number of new infections has fallen each day for the last seven days, though Johnson stressed the pandemic was not over. ""It is very, very important that we don't allow ourselves to run away with premature conclusions about (lower case numbers),"" Johnson told broadcasters, noting it would take a while for the lifting of restrictions in England to feed through to the data. ""People have got to remain very cautious and that remains the approach of the government."" Johnson has lifted restrictions in England and is betting he can get one of Europe's largest economies firing again because so many people are now vaccinated, a decision which marks a new chapter in the response to the novel coronavirus. Imperial College epidemiologist Neil Ferguson said the effective end of Britain's pandemic could be just months away as vaccines have so dramatically reduced the risk of hospitalisation and death. ""We're not completely out of the woods but the equation has fundamentally changed,"" Ferguson, whose modelling of the virus's likely spread at the outset of the pandemic in early 2020 alarmed governments across the world, told the BBC. ""I'm positive that by late September, October time we will be looking back at most of the pandemic."" ON THE WAY DOWN Johnson lifted COVID-19 restrictions in England on July 19. New daily cases in the current wave peaked two days earlier at 54,674 and have since fallen dramatically, to 23,511 new cases on Tuesday. The closure of schools for summer, the end of the Euro 2020 soccer championships and warmer weather are among factors epidemiologists say might have reduced social mixing indoors and therefore cases, even as England's economy has fully reopened. Case numbers have been falling for longer in Scotland, where the recent peak in new infections was on July 1, than in England, corresponding to an earlier elimination from the Euros. ""Both of them seem to coincide in some ways with the end of activity in the Euro 2020 tournament,"" Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, told Reuters, adding that changes in testing patterns might mean that the sharpness of the drop is overstated in daily testing figures. ""(Cases) may go up again, because we're only just going to be starting to see the effect of the complete release of restrictions associated with July 19 in England. So there may still be rises yet to come."" Britain has one of the highest official fatality rates from COVID-19 in the world, with 129,303 deaths, but vaccinations and lockdowns have greatly slowed the rate since March. Scotland's National Clinical Director Jason Leitch said a gradual return to usual social activity would help smooth the end of the current wave, but that the next few weeks would be unpredictable. ""On the way down is always bumpier than the exponential rise on the way up,"" he told Reuters. Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

6," Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in Expert warns of possible ‘resurgence’ in Covid cases after unexpected six-day decline  Neil Ferguson says he is ‘positive’ bulk of pandemic will be behind us by October Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile  The government adviser who warned that daily Covid cases would almost inevitably hit 100,000 has warned of a “resurgence” in the virus in the coming weeks, following six days of falling numbers. Imperial College London professor Neil Ferguson said it would be “several weeks” before the full impact of the removal of lockdown restrictions on 19 July was felt in terms of rising cases, hospitalisations and deaths. But he said that the vaccination campaign had “fundamentally changed” the course of the outbreak, leaving him “positive” that by late September or October, the bulk of the pandemic in the UK will be “behind us”. Prof Ferguson said earlier this month that the current wave of Delta variant cases could top 200,000 before beginning a slow decline into the autumn. But he today said he would be “happy to be proved wrong” after a steady decline in cases from 54,674 on 17 July to 24,950 on Monday. The “unexpected” fall in cases in recent days may be linked to the end of the Euro 2020 football tournament on 11 July and the arrival of heatwave weather, both of which have led to a reduction in people gathering indoors, he said. But he cautioned that this did not mean the latest wave of coronavirus is over. “I think it’s too early to tell,” the epidemiologist told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “The reductions we’re seeing at the moment occurred before the unlocking took place and we won’t see for several more weeks what the effect of the unlocking is. “I’m happy to be proved wrong if it’s wrong in the right direction. If case numbers stay low that will be really good news. “But I think we do have to be slightly cautious. I think probably infections in the community are plateauing, but we’ll see that later this week with the latest Office of National Statistics infection survey. “Positivity - the proportion of cases which test positive - only started going down very, very slightly on 21 July. “We have to monitor quite a lot of different indicators to see what’s going on, but it will probably take several more weeks for us to see the effect of unlocking.”

He said he expects a “clear plateau” in positive cases to emerge this week, following the unexpected fall of the past few days. “The real issue is, will that turn into a long-term decline - which we of course all hope it will - or will we see a resurgence of … hospitalisations and deaths as we go late into the summer and into the autumn,” he said. By the autumn, Prof Ferguson suggested that the pandemic could effectively be over in the UK. “We’ll be able to tell really later this week and then next week whether we see hospitalisations - which are still rising at the moment - start to decline,” he said. “That would give us more confidence that we really have seen a peak - maybe not the peak, but a peak - at the moment. “We need to remain cautious. There is the potential of quite a substantial increase in contact rates again, particularly if the weather remains less fine and schools reopen in September. “We’re not completely out of the woods but the equation has fundamentally changed. The effect of vaccines has been huge in reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death. “I think I’m positive that by late September, October time we will be looking back at most of the pandemic. We’ll still have Covid with us, we’ll still have people dying from Covid, but we will have the bulk of the pandemic behind us. “The higher we can get vaccination coverage the better - that will protect people and reduce transmission. But there is going to be remaining uncertainty until the autumn.” Register for free to continue reading Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists   By clicking ‘Create my account’ you confirm that your data has been entered correctly and you have read and agree to our Terms of use, Cookie policy and Privacy notice.

7," People shielding five times more likely to die of Covid, Scottish study finds High-risk individuals were still much more vulnerable to catching virus and dying in first wave of pandemic People advised to shield in the first wave of the pandemic were five times more likely to die after a confirmed Covid infection than those considered at low risk from the disease, according to research in Scotland. The study, led by the University of Glasgow, found that efforts to shield the most vulnerable did not prevent substantial levels of infection in the most high-risk groups, with many patients succumbing to the virus. The findings raise questions about how effective shielding was in the first wave of the pandemic and show that other measures, from reducing transmission in the community to Covid-safe support at home, are crucial for those most vulnerable to the disease. “The only way you can protect these people is by stopping them getting infected in the first place because they are such a high-risk group,” said Prof Jill Pell, the director of the University of Glasgow’s Institute of Health and Wellbeing. “You cannot simply dump the responsibility on high-risk people to protect themselves because, as we’ve shown, they cannot protect themselves 100%.” In the UK, people who were deemed to be clinically extremely vulnerable to Covid were advised to stay at home, or shield, when case numbers were high. Pell and her colleagues analysed data from more than 1.3 million people registered with GPs in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde between March and May 2020. The majority, 934,239, were considered at low risk from Covid, while 353,085 were at medium risk due to conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. A further 27,747 were advised to shield because of serious health issues that put them at highest risk. Those asked to shield were eight times more likely to have a confirmed Covid infection than those at low risk. And while testing rates were 10 times higher in the shielded group than in the low-risk group, many tests in the first wave were ordered only when people displayed symptoms. Those at medium risk had four times more confirmed infections than the low-risk individuals. When the researchers looked at who died from Covid, whether they were tested or not, they found 140 deaths (0.51%) among the shielded people, 803 deaths (0.23%) in the medium risk group and 84 deaths (0.01%) in those at low risk from the disease. One of the questions the study sought to answer is whether shielding helps to prevent the NHS from becoming overwhelmed. The findings suggest not, because only a fraction of the population are vulnerable enough to shield and far more medium-risk people are hospitalised with Covid. “You would have to roll out shielding to about a third of the population to really impact on NHS burden and that isn’t feasible to do,” said Pell. The main driver for shielding is to protect vulnerable patients, but the researchers believe it is not as effective as hoped. “We don’t know what would have happened to these people if they hadn’t been advised to shield, but the bottom line is that it certainly didn’t prevent them from having adverse outcomes,” Pell said. “These people have medical problems and I don’t think you can realistically expect someone to stay in their house and never leave it for months on end, because whether they like it or not they need to go to hospital appointments, some of them are under domestic pressures to do other things, and they live with other people in the house,” she added. “While it’s easy to say don’t share kitchen facilities, don’t share living space, very few people in the population have two kitchens, two living rooms and two bathrooms. Isolating within the house is almost impossible.” A Scottish government spokesperson said: “We are confident the shielding programme helped vulnerable people who were at risk of Covid at that time. “This study is limited to one geographical area and doesn’t take into account a range of factors including ethnicity, rurality, exposure to health and social care workers, and compliance with restrictions. It also highlights that the findings are representative of Glasgow and Greater Clyde area but may be less so for other areas.” Most popular Most popular","Tue, 27 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/27/people-shielding-still-eight-times-more-likely-to-get-covid-19-study-finds,"People shielding five times more likely to die of Covid, Scottish study finds - The Guardian"
8," COVID-19: Weekly coronavirus-related deaths in England and Wales highest since April, says ONS The figures are likely to reflect the impact of the third wave of COVID-19, which started in May and led to a surge in cases and hospital admissions. Tuesday 27 July 2021 15:25, UK England and Wales have recorded the highest number of weekly coronavirus-related deaths since April, according to latest data. There were 218 deaths with coronavirus mentioned on the death certificate in the week to 16 July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It is the third consecutive weekly rise and a 19% increase on the previous seven days. It is also the highest since 260 COVID-related deaths were registered in the week to 23 April. Live COVID-19 updates from the UK and around the world However, deaths are a fraction of what they were during the peak of the second wave of infections in the winter. The figures come as one expert, SAGE member Professor Neil Ferguson, said the worst of the pandemic could be over by late September after daily cases fell for a sixth day in a row on Monday.

                 The area with the most COVID-related deaths was the North West, according to the ONS data. It recorded 71 in the week ending 16 July - the highest since 106 in the week ending 26 March. The second worst-affected region was the North East, which had 24 deaths - the highest since 35 deaths in the week up to 26 March. Both areas have been regional hotspots for cases and hospital admissions during the third wave, which started in May.

The professor, whose modelling led to the first lockdown in March 2020, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need to remain cautious, especially with the potential increase in contact rates again as the weather becomes less fine and schools return. ""We're not completely out of the woods, but the equation has fundamentally changed. The effect of vaccines is hugely reducing the risk of hospitalisations and death. ""And I'm positive that by late September or October time we will be looking back at most of the pandemic. He added: ""We will have COVID with us, we will still have people dying from COVID, but we'll have put the bulk of the pandemic behind us."" The latest ONS figures also show an increase in care home residents dying with COVID, but again the numbers remain very low compared with previous peaks. Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts,  Google Podcasts,  Spotify, Spreaker Twenty-seven were registered up to 16 July, up from 20 the week before. In total, 42,614 care home residents in England and Wales have had coronavirus recorded on their death certificate since the pandemic began. The overall ONS count for COVID deaths in the UK is 154,661. It is higher than the government's 129,172 figure, which just counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

 Tuesday 27 July 2021 23:41, UK The UK has recorded 23,511 new COVID-19 cases and 131 more coronavirus-related deaths in the latest 24-hour period, according to government data. It is the seventh day in a row that the number of infections has fallen. But it is the highest number of daily deaths since 17 March, when 141 fatalities were reported. It takes the total number of people who have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive COVID test to 129,303. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that since the pandemic began there have been 154,000 deaths registered in the UK where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate. Follow live COVID updates from the UK and across the world Responding to Tuesday's data, Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England (PHE), said: ""Rates are still high and the pandemic is not over yet, today we have recorded the highest number of deaths since March.

                 ""This is in part due to the high number of cases recorded in recent weeks. We know deaths follow when there are a high number of cases and data today highlights we are still in the third wave."" She continued: ""We can all help. Meeting outside is safer than inside, get two doses of the vaccine as soon as you can and isolate if you are told to by NHS Test & Trace. If you show symptoms, stay home and get a PCR test. Limiting your contacts is the best way to stop the virus spreading."" Today's figures compare with 24,950 infections and 14 deaths reported yesterday, while 46,558 cases and 96 deaths were announced this time last week. Also, 64,585 people had their first dose of a COVID vaccine yesterday, taking the total to 46,653,796. And a further 171,676 people had their second jab, meaning 37,459,060 are now fully vaccinated. The latest data has shown that England and Wales recorded the highest number of weekly coronavirus-related deaths since April. There were 218 deaths with coronavirus mentioned on the death certificate in the week to 16 July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) - the third consecutive weekly rise and a 19% increase on the previous seven days. Speaking to reporters earlier, Boris Johnson acknowledged the falling case numbers over the past week. He said: ""I've noticed that, obviously, we are six days into some better figures. ""But it is very, very important that we don't allow ourselves to run away with premature conclusions about this. ""Step four of the opening up only took place a few days ago; people have got to remain very cautious and that remains of the approach of the government."" Earlier, policing minister Kit Malthouse told Sky News he thought the falling cases was an ""interesting cocktail of effects"" - and it seems to be a common theory in government that a number of factors are contributing to the decrease.   SAGE member Professor Mark Walport admitted ""everyone's scratching their heads a little bit as to exactly what the explanation is"", while other scientists have urged caution. And Dr Duncan Robertson, an expert in COVID-19 modelling and analysis, said we should be looking at the positivity rate (or percentage of tests coming back positive) - which remains ""very high"" and could indicate not enough testing is being carried out.

11," Covid: Bradford's Matthew Keenan dies despite changing mind on jabs A ""self-confessed vaccine sceptic"" has died in hospital just two weeks after a doctor shared his picture to urge others to get the Covid jab. Matthew Keenan, from Bradford, died a fortnight after allowing Leanne Cheyne to post the image of him hooked up to an oxygen mask. Dr Cheyne, a respiratory consultant, said the 34-year-old dad had told her he wished he ""could turn back time"". Tributes paid to Mr Keenan described him as ""a top bloke"" and ""a real gem"". Posting the image on Twitter on 11 July, Dr Cheyne wrote: ""Matthew, has agreed for me to share his story. 34, footie coach & dad. Self-confessed vaccine sceptic until he caught Covid, if he could turn back time he would. Our sickest patients are unvaccinated & under 40. Matthew is fighting for his life... save yours."" She explained that Mr Keenan, who wrote on his own Facebook page on 2 July that he had just tested positive for Covid, was connected to a CPAP machine which was delivering oxygen to him. Dr Cheyne, who works at Bradford Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust, said Mr Keenan's treatment was one step below being on the intensive care unit. She told the BBC Mr Keenan hoped her sharing his story would encourage others to get vaccinated.   In Bradford, 72% of adults have had their first vaccine dose and 57% have had a second dose as of 25 July.  Tributes were paid to the well-known local football coach following the news of his death being reported at the weekend. A spokesman for the Bradford Sunday Alliance Football League said: ""Matthew was absolutely a top bloke, a gent, a true legend and always had time for everyone even if he didn't know them and always put a smile on everyone's face. He loved his football and dreamed of winning the Premier League and he achieved [this] with the Station boys."" Fellow football league member Akif Khan, of Toller FC, said Mr Keenan was ""a real gem"" who ""always tried his best for everyone"".  On Facebook, mental health support group the Speak In Club wrote: ""Absolutely gutted to hear of the passing of my mate Matthew Keenan. Genuinely one of the nicest people you will ever meet and the life and soul of everything. He lit up everywhere he stepped. Fly high my brother. You Will Never walk Alone."" Bradford rap group Bad Boy Chiller Crew also paid tribute, writing: ""Can't believe we're writing this but Bradford has lost a absolute legend. RIP, you will always be remembered in all of our hearts until we meet again.""  An online fundraiser has been started to help Mr Keenan's family and collections will be held at local amateur football games. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

12," Intended for healthcare professionals Search form Covid-19: Countries dump vaccines as demand slumps and sharing proves difficult Read our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic The US, the UK, and the Netherlands face throwing away tens of thousands of covid-19 vaccine doses that are due to expire. The US had already thrown out more than 180 000 vaccine doses by the end of March,1 and some states, including Iowa and Arkansas, have warned that they have thousands more doses set to expire soon. Meanwhile, vaccine administrators in the UK now report that they too are having to discard doses, as strict rules around dosing intervals and fewer people coming forward for their first dose have led to supply far exceeding demand.2 But the UK and the US, where vaccine coverage is high, are not the only countries experiencing these issues. The World Health Organization reports that 23 African countries have used fewer than half of the doses they have received so far, and about 1.25 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in 18 countries are set to expire at the end of August.3 Malawi and South Sudan have already destroyed around 20 000 and 59 000 vaccine doses, respectively.4 Why the waste? Robert Ator, a retired colonel leading Arkansas’s covid-19 vaccine distribution drive, told the Stat news website, “We’re drowning in this stuff . . . It’s starting to get a bit silly.”5 However, repeated requests from state health departments to redistribute stock to other countries have reportedly been denied by the federal government owing to legal and logistical challenges. The same issues are being faced elsewhere. A group of doctors in the Netherlands have been attempting to ship vaccine doses to other countries but have been blocked by a law that prevents any medicine delivered to doctors for their patients from being traded in.6 Vaccine hesitancy and logistical issues have slowed rollout, especially in countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, where vaccine doses have been sold to other countries despite low coverage at home. And in the UK health leaders have urged young adults to come forward for their vaccinations, as interest among this group seems to have waned. Pippa Nightingale, chief nursing officer at Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, said recently, “Our vaccination centres are only really operating to about 30% of their capacity, because that’s the people that are turning up. We’ve got staff there, we’ve got vaccines there, but we are really struggling. That’s the picture across London; it’s also a picture across the country.”7 Countries that have tried to send vaccines nearing expiry to other countries have also found it difficult to find recipients able to take the stock and distribute it before the expiry date. In July, Israel had one million vaccine doses due to expire and attempted to send them to countries including Palestine and the UK, as part of deals that would see the countries send back the same number of doses later in the year. Both deals fell through, but Israel eventually agreed a swap for 700 000 doses with South Korea.8 Vaccine sharing is “short term solution” At a press conference on 21 July WHO’s director general, Tedros Ghebreyesus, said, “Over 3.5 billion vaccines have been distributed globally, but more than 75% of those have gone to just 10 countries. Vaccine inequity is not only a moral failure, it is also epidemiologically and economically self-defeating.” WHO has set a global target to vaccinate at least 10% of every country’s population by September, 40% by the end of 2021, and 70% by the middle of 2022. To achieve this, said Ghebreyesus, 11 billion doses were needed—and vaccine sharing, while helpful, was only a short term solution. “We need to dramatically scale up the number of vaccines being produced,” he said. “This can be done by removing the barriers to scaling up manufacturing, including through technology transfer, freeing up supply chains, and IP [intellectual property] waivers.” This article is made freely available for use in accordance with BMJ's website terms and conditions for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic or until otherwise determined by BMJ.

A dose of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is administered at the Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv, Israel.Credit: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Many vaccines have been shown to provide strong protection against COVID-19. Now, growing evidence finds that they also substantially reduce the risk of passing on the virus SARS-CoV-2 — crucial information for governments making decisions about how best to control the pandemic. However, the studies were done before the highly transmissible Delta variant became prevalent — and scientists say it might be more easily spread by vaccinated people than are earlier variants. Two studies1,2 from Israel, posted as preprints on 16 July, find that two doses of the vaccine made by pharmaceutical company Pfizer, based in New York City, and biotechnology company BioNTech, based in Mainz, Germany, are 81% effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections. And vaccinated people who do get infected are up to 78% less likely to spread the virus to household members than are unvaccinated people. Overall, this adds up to very high protection against transmission, say researchers. The studies reflect population-level trends, say researchers. “It’s good news,” says Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. “But it’s not quite good enough,” she notes, because it means that vaccinated people can still occasionally spread the infection. And the highly transmissible Delta variant is a major source of uncertainty. The Israeli studies and others are based on the circulation of earlier variants, in particular Alpha, but research suggests that vaccines offer slightly reduced protection against Delta. Robust estimates The studies “help us understand why cases were falling in most highly vaccinated populations before the emergence of the Delta variant”, says Marm Kilpatrick, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “If that variant hadn’t arisen and spread, it’s likely that case burdens would be very, very low in many countries” with high rates of vaccination, he says. The studies provide robust estimates for various aspects of transmission that had previously been inferred through multiple studies, says Kilpatrick. 
 Six months of COVID vaccines: what 1.7 billion doses have taught scientists The first study1, co-authored by researchers in Israel and France, looked at transmission in 210 households of infected people who worked at the Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv, which is Israel’s largest hospital. The data come from between December 2020 and April 2021 — a time when a massive vaccination drive in Israel was competing with a surge in cases driven by Alpha. The second study2, co-authored by researchers in Israel and the United States, was based on a retrospective analysis of data from about 66,000 multiperson households with at least one infected member, collected by Maccabi Healthcare Services, a large health-care provider based in Tel Aviv, Israel, between June 2020 and March 2021. Both studies found that two doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine were 81% effective at preventing infections. Those who did get infected were also less likely to pass the infection to household members than were unvaccinated individuals. The first study saw a drop of 78%, and the second 41%, in infectiousness — with the large difference in numbers perhaps explained by the fact that the estimates are based on a very small number of vaccinated people who were infected and then infected others. Reduce infectiousness Nevertheless, “both papers provide good evidence of a substantial reduction in infectiousness”, says Elizabeth Halloran, a biostatistician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. And whereas the studies provide an insight into transmission within households, the protection could be even higher outside the home, where people might be exposed to smaller doses of virus, notes Kilpatrick. Although most of the benefit is because vaccines prevent infection in the first place, “the fact that they also reduce the infectiousness of breakthrough cases is important and reassuring”, says Virginia Pitzer, an infectious-diseases modeller at Yale School of Public Health in New Haven, Connecticut, and co-author of one of the Israel studies2. The results correspond well with studies conducted elsewhere. One analysis3 of some 365,000 households in the United Kingdom, published on 23 June, estimated that individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 were 40–50% less likely to spread the infection if they had received at least one dose of the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine or that developed by the University of Oxford, UK, and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, based in Cambridge, UK, at least three weeks previously A study4 from Finland, posted as a preprint on 10 July, found that spouses of infected health-care workers who had received a single dose of the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine or that produced by Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts, were 43% less likely to get infected than were spouses of unvaccinated health workers. Confounding factor of Delta But studies on Alpha and other variants cannot be easily generalized to Delta, says Steven Riley, an infectious-diseases researcher at Imperial College London. So far, there are no published data on how vaccines affect infections and infectiousness with Delta, but a UK study5 published on 21 July shows that the Pfizer–BioNTech and Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccines both protect slightly less well against symptomatic disease caused by Delta than against that caused by Alpha. This could also mean a drop in how well they protect against transmission of Delta, but there is still a lot of uncertainty, says Dean. 
 COVID vaccines to reach poorest countries in 2023 — despite recent pledges Unpublished preliminary data from Israel’s Ministry of Health show that Delta could chip away at some of the reduction in transmission provided by the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine. And case numbers have risen sharply in Israel following Delta’s arrival, despite more than 60% of the population being fully vaccinated. This hints at what might happen elsewhere, say researchers. Even if vaccines are just as effective at preventing infections with Delta as with earlier variants, if Delta is more infectious, transmission in households could still increase, says Dean. A study6 from China, posted as a preprint on 12 July, found that the concentration of viral particles — a proxy for infectiousness — in people infected with Delta was roughly 1,000 times that in people infected with the original strain of SARS-CoV-2. Delta’s increased infectiousness could mean that the proportion of people in a population who need to be vaccinated to bring the pandemic under control will be larger than would have been required with earlier variants. Nature 596, 17-18 (2021) doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-02054-z Correction 13 August 2021: An earlier version of this story said the studies had seen a drop of 78% and 41%, in reduction of infectiousness.

Live feed This blog is closing now but thanks very much for reading. We’ll be back in a few hours with more rolling coverage of the pandemic from all around the world. In the meantime you can catch up with all our coverage of the pandemic here. New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian is expected to shortly announce a four-week extension to the Greater Sydney lockdown. The Guardian understands Berejiklian will not be introducing curfews, but the government is exploring rapid antigen testing for year 12 students to allow them to return to school ahead of their HSC exams. Other years will be expected to remain at home for their schooling over the additional four-week period. These rapid tests may also be used at essential workplaces such as supermarkets. A singles bubble, which would allow those who live alone to visit one other person in the same circumstances, is also likely to be introduced for this next phase of the lockdown.  Flexible working should become the “new normal” after the experience during the coronavirus pandemic, Labour said. With millions moving to home working almost overnight in March 2020 in response to the first national coronavirus lockdown, the opposition party in England is calling for the right to flexible working to be made mandatory in all jobs to ensure that “work fits around people’s lives instead of dictating their lives”. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said the concept would not just be about allowing people to work from home, as they have done to reduce Covid-19 transmissions over the past 16 months, but should also include flexible, compressed, staggered or annualised hours.  Kuwait’s civil aviation authority said all arrivals must have a negative Covid-19 PCR test before they board their flights and must not be showing any symptoms.  All arrivals will have to be home quarantined for seven days unless they take a Covid-19 PCR test inside Kuwait that comes out negative, Reuters reports. The Kuwaiti government on Monday eased some coronavirus related restrictions and resumed all activities except for gatherings which include conferences, weddings and social events. US president Joe Biden will announce on Thursday a requirement that all federal employees and contractors be vaccinated against Covid-19 or be required to submit to regular testing, CNN reported. The latest Covid situation in Australia: Americans fully vaccinated against Covid-19 should go back to wearing masks in indoor public places in regions where the coronavirus and especially the Delta variant are spreading rapidly, US authorities said. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommended all students and teachers at kindergarten up to 12th grade schools wear masks regardless of vaccination status. The CDC said children should return to full-time, in-person learning in the autumn with proper prevention strategies.  The changes mark a reversal of the CDC’s announcement in May that prompted millions of vaccinated Americans to shed their face coverings, Reuters reports. A summary of today's developments Theatre lovers in Northern Ireland have been treated to a live performance for the first time since the start of the pandemic. Only 90 minutes after regulations formally changed to permit theatres to reopen, the lights went down at the Lyric Theatre for the opening night of Dracula in Belfast. It was the first audience the venue had hosted for 16 months. Rules meant the 390-capacity theatre was only a third full and all audience members had to comply with a range of Covid mitigation measures, including the wearing of face masks, PA reports. The US had administered 342,607,540 doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the country and distributed 395,460,845 doses as of Tuesday morning, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The figures are up from the 342,212,051 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by 26 July, out of 394,949,575 doses delivered. It said 188,996,475 people had received at least one dose, while 163,312,474 people were fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, Reuters reports. Kuwait said it will only allow vaccinated citizens to travel abroad starting August 1, the government communication office reported. The statement excepted children under age 16, those with a health ministry certificate saying they cannot be vaccinated, and pregnant women who get a pregnancy proof certificate from authorities, Reuters reports. Plans to significantly open up international travel are expected to be announced on Wednesday, with UK ministers poised to let people who have been fully vaccinated in the US and EU avoid quarantine if arriving from amber list countries. The move would benefit millions of people by finally letting them be reunited with family and friends based in the UK, as well as businesses in the aviation and tourism sectors that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Currently, only those who have been inoculated by the NHS are eligible for a “Covid pass” to show upon return that would allow them to skip the self-isolation period of up to 10 days if coming from an amber list country, under the rules of the traffic light system that grades countries according to their case, variant and vaccination rates. Corporate landlords in the US continue to evict tenants - many of them people from ethnic minorities during the Covid-19 pandemic, despite a federal ban on evictions, a congressional panel was told. The hearings followed last week’s announcement by the U.S. House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis of an investigation into the practice, Reuters reports. “Let me be clear, the aggressive actions of these large corporate landlords are unacceptable, and they must stop immediately,” said Representative James Clyburn, the panel’s chairman. British prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to approve the reopening of England’s doors to double-vaccinated tourists from the EU and the US, Financial Times reported. UK ministers pushed the prime minister to act, arguing that it was safe to start re-admitting foreign tourists without the need for quarantine if they had received two vaccine doses, the newspaper said. Major aged care providers in the UK have warned vaccination rates for their home care staff remain extraordinarily low, just days after the government conceded it still has no specific plan for vaccinating the workforce. About 150,000 aged care workers provide care to about 1 million older Australians in their own homes across the country, but the government revealed on Friday it still has no dedicated plan for vaccinating home care staff and has given the issue little focus. It has not extended the vaccine mandate for residential workers to home care workers, despite warnings weeks ago that it was an “obvious blind spot” in the rollout.

16," Covid: Alert over inaccurate thermometers bought in UK By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online There has been a rise in the sale of unreliable infrared thermometers in the UK, say regulators who are advising people to check before they buy.  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says the Covid pandemic has created demand for devices that screen for a raised temperature.  Accurate ones should carry a CE or UKCA mark, it advises.  But people should also be aware that temperature screening is not a reliable way to detect Covid. Anyone who thinks they may be infected should have a swab test.  The main symptoms of Covid, says the NHS, are: Some people have other symptoms too, such as fatigue, muscle aches and a headache, but others can have none and still be infected.  In July 2020, the MHRA issued a warning to manufacturers and suppliers of thermal cameras which cautioned them against making claims which directly relate to Covid diagnosis. MHRA spokesman Graeme Tunbridge said: ""People in the UK are unknowingly buying poor-quality infrared thermometers which do not meet the required standards of safety and performance. ""It is important that people know what to look out for when purchasing these products, or any other medical devices online. You should always look for the CE or UKCA mark on any medical device - this will either be on the device or on its packaging, and that includes when you are buying these products online.""

17," Covid: pressure on Bristol hospital causing 'challenging' period A city hospital says it is a particularly challenging time as teams try to cope with rising patient numbers and staff being required to isolate.  Dr Lailah Dare compared the current situation at Southmead Hospital in Bristol to the traditionally busier winter period. She said there had been an increase in Covid patients, along with those requiring regular treatments. ""We go through ups and downs but it's challenging at the moment,"" she said. Dr Dare works as an emergency medicine consultant and described the situation as ""a perfect storm"" with many factors contributing to the busy period. It comes as the daily number of Covid cases recorded in the UK fell for the seventh consecutive day on Tuesday. However, there were a further 131 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test, the highest daily number since March, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying people should ""remain cautious"".  Dr Dare continued: ""We're seeing an increase of people with Covid, we're seeing people who are majorly injured and people who are very unwell. ""The heat does generate its own health issues and people are enjoying the post-lockdown phase so we're seeing a lot of minor injuries and illness as a result of that as well,"" she said. Thousands of work days have been lost due to Covid at Bristol hospitals since the start of the pandemic.  Across June, an average of 49 staff a day were absent at North Bristol NHS Trust, which runs Southmead Hospital, after they contracted the virus or needed to self-isolate. That had fallen to an average of 33 a day in May, NHS figures show whereas in January, at the peak of the second wave, an average of 291 staff a day were absent. Dr Dare added the rise in coronavirus case numbers was impacting on staff numbers again and making it a ""particularly challenging"" time. ""We're definitely seeing an effect of staff contracting Covid or being contact traced,"" she said. Tony Rawlings, from Southmead, said his wife Margaret waited for about eight hours to be seen at the hospital after suffering from chest pains. He said paramedics took three hours to arrive when he initially called them to their home. They treated her but when the pains returned later, he drove her to hospital himself because he felt it would be quicker. ""I was surprised with how long it took for the ambulance to arrive but they did explain they've been very busy.  ""She had to wait ages inside, maybe about eight hours before someone saw her,"" Mr Rawlings said.   Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

18," UK scientists designed world's most sophisticated COVID-19 sequencing system – here's how they did it New bioinformatics software and cloud computing approaches developed at the University of Birmingham, have enabled the UK's COVID-19 genome sequencing effort to be the most sophisticated in the world. New bioinformatics software and cloud computing approaches developed at the University of Birmingham, have enabled the UK’s COVID-19 genome sequencing effort to be the most sophisticated in the world. The system, called CLIMB-COVID was designed for the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium, set up in March 2020 to tackle the huge challenge of rapidly sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes. In a new paper, published this month in Genome Biology, the research team discussed the approach they took. The first version of CLIMB-COVID was designed and built by researchers at the University of Birmingham and Cardiff University in under a month and has been instrumental in processing the sequencing data of more than 675,000 coronavirus genomes, including identifying and tracking the Alpha and Delta variants that became dominant in the UK. CLIMB-COVID also integrates new software from collaborators at the University of Edinburgh and the Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance. CLIMB-COVID enables a distributed sequencing system, harnessing sequencing capability from universities, academic institutes and the UK’s four public health agencies. The CLIMB-COVID software and database infrastructure was able to receive all this data, process it and help analyse it into interpretable outputs for public health analysts. All the data from the project has been integrated and shared in real-time. Not only has this enabled the UK’s public health agencies to work together more easily, but enabling seamless access and collaboration with academics, also enabled the early detection and evaluation of new variants of the virus. Understanding viral evolution is important for understanding how the virus is spreading in local, national and international settings. It provides valuable epidemiological information revealing the chains of transmission that must be stopped in order to stop outbreaks. Dr Samuel Nicholls, lead author on the paper, says: “Building this kind of decentralised sequencing system has not been possible before now, because the software infrastructure has not been available. By designing that system, we have shown how genetic sequencing can be used as a vital tool in any public health response.” The COG-UK consortium benefited particularly from cloud computing resources established as part of the CLIMB-BIG-DATA project in which the University of Birmingham and Cardiff University has played a pivotal role, as well as the University of Birmingham’s BEAR high performance computing infrastructure which provided additional capacity. This cloud infrastructure provides the computing and storage capacity required to analyse the large genome datasets produced by the consortium, as well as facilitating national and international research capabilities. Dr Nicholls adds: “The CLIMB-COVID system is open source. That means anyone in the world can access our computer code and all genomic data, and can see how we work. We have never seen such a co-ordinated, sustained effort to generate real-time genomic surveillance data at this scale and pace and this is why the UK is world-leading in the genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2.” For media enquiries please contact Beck Lockwood, Press Office, University of Birmingham, tel: +44 (0)781 3343348. The University of Birmingham is ranked amongst the world’s top 100 institutions. Its work brings people from across the world to Birmingham, including researchers, teachers and more than 6,500 international students from over 150 countries.

20," Intended for healthcare professionals Search form Covid-19: One third of trainees are affected by burnout, GMC survey finds Read our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic The covid-19 pandemic has increased the level of burnout in trainees and risks reversing recent improvements to their workload and wellbeing, the General Medical Council (GMC) has warned. Of the 46 793 trainees in the UK who completed the annual national survey (a 76% response rate),1 33% said that they felt burnt out from work to a high or very high degree, and 43% found their work emotionally exhausting to a high or very high degree. Questions on burnout were added to the survey in 2018, and this year’s results are the worst recorded. When the survey asked trainees whether they felt worn out at the end of the working day, over 17% said that they always did and 42% said that they often did. Over a third (37%) reported that they “always” or “often” felt exhausted in the morning at the thought of another day at work. Charlie Massey, GMC chief executive, said that it was not surprising for burnout to have worsened during the pandemic but that trainees could not continue to work at such high levels of intensity. “As health services emerge from covid-19 pressures will remain, but we must not risk reversing the gains that have been made in recent years,” he said. “The danger is that, unless action is taken, workloads and wellbeing will continue to suffer, and future burnout rates could get even worse.” Training opportunities Trainees were also asked about the impact of the pandemic on their training. Just over a quarter (26%) agreed that they had been given effective alternatives through simulation facilities or simulation exercises to make up for missed training opportunities. Two fifths (41%) of trainees agreed that they had been able to compensate for the loss of training opportunities through transferable skills gained from other aspects of training. And most trainees (81%) said that they were on course to meet their 2021 curriculum competencies or outcomes for their stage of training. Massey said, “We know many trainees remain concerned about their training progression, so we are working hard to ensure training is flexible, fair, and helps prepare doctors to meet current and future patient needs.” Responding to the survey’s findings, Sarah Hallett, chair of the BMA’s Junior Doctors Committee, said that while it was good to see a large proportion of trainees rating the quality of their training highly, it was very worrying that one in 10 junior doctors was concerned about progressing through training. “We are the consultants, GPs, and specialists of the future, and the highly skilled clinicians that the NHS will rely on for decades to come,” she said. “As the health service moves to the next phase of managing the pandemic and working through the huge backlog of care, the wellbeing and training needs of junior doctors must be prioritised.” Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said that the survey showed the toll that the intense workload created by the pandemic had had on GP trainees and their trainers. “Our trainees are the future of the profession and the care we are able to deliver to patients in general practice, so we must address these issues,” he said.

The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list Earlier in the pandemic, it appeared that the majority of people infected with the coronavirus experienced mild-to-moderate symptoms and generally recovered within two to three weeks, depending on the severity of their illness. However, as time has passed, it’s become clear that some people, regardless of the severity of their disease, continue to experience symptoms beyond the acute phase of infection. This has become known as “long COVID”. Emerging evidence suggests that these patients experience a range of persistent symptoms and health complications. These may have a significant impact on their quality of life, physical and mental health, and ability to return to work.  But understanding long COVID is difficult. Its reported symptoms are highly varied, making it difficult to define. Many sufferers also weren’t hospitalised during the acute phase of their infection, and so weren’t tested for the coronavirus during the first wave of the pandemic. This makes it more difficult to understand what the potential causes of their long-lasting symptoms are, and also how these relate to symptoms that patients had during the early stages of infection. We and other researchers from the Therapies for Long COVID (TLC) Study Group at the University of Birmingham therefore decided to try to build a clearer picture of what long COVID is and what influences it by pooling data from lots of separate studies. This gave us a view of the prevalence of reported symptoms, and better allowed us to see what the impacts and complications of long COVID are. Here’s what we discovered. Symptoms of long COVID Our review showed just how varied long COVID is. Patients may experience symptoms related to any system in the body – including respiratory, neurological and gastroenterological symptoms. Our pooled data showed that the ten most commonly reported symptoms in long COVID are fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle pain, cough, headache, joint pain, chest pain, an altered sense of smell, diarrhoea and altered taste.  Other common symptoms include “brain fog” – when thinking is fuzzy and sluggish – memory loss, disordered sleep, heart palpitations and a sore throat. Rare but important outcomes include thoughts of self-harm and suicide and even seizures. Most long COVID patients complain of symptoms experienced during their acute infection persisting beyond it, with the number of symptoms experienced tending to decline as patients move from acute to long COVID. Some, though, report developing new symptoms during their long COVID illness, while some also report symptoms reoccuring that had previously resolved themselves.  One of the studies we included in our review described two main symptom clusters of long COVID: those comprising exclusively of fatigue, headache and upper respiratory complaints; and those that are multi-system complaints, including ongoing fever and gastroenterological symptoms. This division encapsulates the difficulty of trying to pin long COVID down – it is a wide-ranging condition containing many types of complaints. The mid-term and long-term effects and impacts of long COVID are yet to be fully understood. However, the evidence we reviewed suggests that people with long COVID may experience significant reductions in their quality of life, difficulties carrying out their daily activities or returning to full-time employment, as well as mental health issues.  One study reported that nearly a quarter of previously hospitalised COVID-19 patients suffered from anxiety or depression six months after the onset of their symptoms. People with long COVID often report being dismissed by healthcare professionals and receiving little or no support for the management of their condition – underlining the need for better treatments. What increases the likelihood of long COVID? We found that a range of factors are associated with developing long COVID. For instance, one study reported that the presence of more than five symptoms of COVID-19 in the first week of infection was significantly associated with developing long COVID, irrespective of age or gender.  In addition, being older, female and hospitalised at symptom onset were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of developing long COVID. However, several studies showed that for a significant number of patients, developing long COVID didn’t seem to be tied to the severity of their initial illness. Experiencing certain symptoms during the acute phase of infection – such as initial breathlessness, chest pain or abnormal heart sounds – was also strongly associated with developing long-lasting symptoms. Having co-morbidities, particularly asthma, also raised the risk.  What the huge variability of long COVID suggests is that it actually comprises a number of different syndromes, potentially with different underlying causes. A better understanding of the underlying biological and immunological mechanisms of long COVID is therefore urgently needed if we’re to develop effective treatments for it.  The impacts that patients report – on their lives, work and mental health – make it clear that better ways of caring for people with long COVID patients are urgently needed. As well as evaluating symptoms and investigating the underlying mechanisms of long COVID, our TLC Study Group was set up to identify potential interventions for treating long COVID that could be evaluated in clinical trials. Armed with the knowledge from this research, this is what we’re aiming to work towards next.

22," Fury over 'misleading' Covid hospital figures as it's revealed half of patients only test positive AFTER admission for another illness — but NHS bosses say they're 'as busy now as they were in January' By Emily Craig Health Reporter For Mailonline   Published:  10:55, 27 July 2021   |  Updated:  09:44, 28 July 2021      1.1k View  comments  More than half of people labelled as a Covid hospital patient in England only tested positive after being admitted for a different reason, leaked figures show.  The NHS England data suggests the pressure of the third wave on hospitals may be even less severe than the daily numbers let on. There were 827 patients admitted for Covid in England last Thursday, according to the Government's coronavirus dashboard.  But 56 per cent of these were only diagnosed with the virus after being in hospital for a different illness, with some patients only testing positive weeks later, according to data seen by The Telegraph.   Experts slammed the finding as 'misleading' and said officials must do more to differentiate between actual Covid admissions and 'incidental' cases.   Increased testing - officials are doing more now than ever before - and high levels of transmission in the community will have played a role, they said.   It comes after MailOnline's analysis earlier this month found 40 per cent of Covid 'admissions' were in hospital for other reasons.   Tory MPs are now demanding new figures be published every day to paint a clearer picture of pressures on the NHS.  But health service bosses claimed today that trusts are just as busy as they were in the second wave of the pandemic, when there were more than 4,000 Covid admissions per day. They said medics were juggling frantic efforts to chop down the 5.3million backlog of patients before winter as well as record numbers in A&E admissions. It comes as Covid infections fell for the sixth day in a row in the UK for the first time since November. Latest hospital admission data shows there were 922 on July 22, up a quarter on the previous week. The red bars show the number of patients being admitted to hospitals in England every day up July 20, while the blue bars show hospital admissions during the second wave, which peaked in January when 4,134 went to hospital with Covid in a single day Figures for hospitalisations in England show that just 44 per cent of the 827 people categorised as being hospitalised with Covid last Thursday tested positive in the two weeks before going to hospital. An additional 43 per cent tested positive for the virus within two days of being admitted, while the remaining 13 per cent were found to have the virus after two days in hospital Figures for hospitalisations in England show that just 44 per cent of the 827 people categorised as being hospitalised with Covid last Thursday tested positive in the two weeks before going to hospital. An additional 43 per cent tested positive for the virus shortly after admission, while the remaining 13 per cent were found to have the virus after two days in hospital. Covid testing is mandatory in all hospitals and patients are regularly checked for the virus, no matter what they are in hospital for.  It means patients giving birth or getting routine operations may be being added to the daily numbers. RELATED ARTICLES Share this article More than 5million people in England are now waiting for NHS hospital treatment — the highest number ever recorded.  Official data released in June showed the number now stands at 5.12million, and has risen consistently since the Covid pandemic began. Statistics released for the first time also revealed the true extent of the NHS backlog, with almost 65,000 patients waiting at least 18 months for routine operations, such as hip and knee replacements. Around 2,700 patients haven't been treated within two years. Critics slammed the 'grim milestone', calling on ministers to make tackling the 'gigantic' backlog their top priority. The Royal College of Surgeons called the data on patients waiting at least one year 'particularly troubling'. Hospitals turned their attention to treating coronavirus patients during the first and second waves, cancelling thousands of non-urgent procedures.  Health chiefs fear non-Covid care could be threatened again if the Indian variant's rapid spread — which has left hopes of 'Freedom Day' going ahead on a knife-edge — causes hospital admissions to spike.  Vaccines have broken the link between cases and serious illness, but SAGE advisers still fear the mutant strain could trigger a 'substantial' third wave. Millions of over-50s have yet to be fully vaccinated and data shows a single dose is slightly less effective against the Delta variant, which has bolstered calls for No10 to delay June 21 to give the NHS more time to dish out top-up jabs.  Hospitalisations are also significantly lower now than in the previous waves. At the peak of the first wave last April, the number of people seeking hospital care hit 3,099. Daily figures jumped to 4,134 at the peak of the second wave in January.   Professor Carl Heneghan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford, told The Telegraph: 'This data is incredibly important, and it should be published on an ongoing basis. 'When people hear about hospitalisations with Covid, they will assume that Covid is the likely cause, but this data shows something quite different – this is about Covid being detected after tests were looking for it.' He said the Government should publish clearer figures to outline whether the virus was the primary cause of admission, as the numbers could be exaggerating NHS pressure. Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory MPs, told the paper: 'Nearly 18 months into the Covid crisis, it is absurd that data breaking down hospital admissions still isn't publicly available on a regular basis. 'Counting all patients who test positive as Covid hospitalisations is inevitably misleading and gives a false picture of the continuing health impact of the virus.' Greg Clark, the chairman of Commons science and technology select committee said he would ask Health Secretary Sajid Javid to regularly release a breakdown of numbers actually in hospital due to the virus.  An NHS spokesman said: 'Many patients are admitted to hospital because of their Covid symptoms and complications, which are then confirmed with a post-admission Covid test, and for others they may initially be presymptomatic or asymptomatic.' A NHS data expert told the Telegraph: 'It creates an impression that all these people are going into hospital with Covid, and that simply is not the case. 'People are worried and scared and not really understanding the true picture – that is what I find despicable.' NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson warned the NHS 'feels as busy as it did' in January during the peak of the second wave Cambridge University epidemiologist Dr Raghib Ali and Dr Simon Clarke, a microbiologist at Reading University, told MailOnline that 'incidental' hospital Covid cases will become more common as the outbreak grows. There are still some patients who fall gravely ill with the virus and do not get tested until they arrive at hospital, Dr Raghib said, but this is happening less often now that testing is so widespread.  Fewer people are becoming severely ill thanks to the vaccines. Professor Paul Hunter, an expert in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that by next winter 'most cases admitted with a positive test will not be admitted because of Covid'.  But Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, told Times Radio this morning the health service is facing as much pressure as it did in January, despite treating less Covid patients. Hospitals are still required to separate any patient who tests positive, no matter what condition they were primarily admitted for, which puts extra pressure on the NHS.  Stringent infection control measures and repeated lockdowns during the pandemic have led to a record waiting list of 5.3million in England.  He said: 'What's particularly striking is how much over the last few weeks our trust chief executives have said the pressure and the shape of the pressure is very different in terms of the Covid caseload is much lower. 'But if you add all of the things we've got going on, full pelt on the backlog recovery, we've got record demand for urgent care. 'We have got growing numbers of Covid cases, we've then lost about 10,000 to 15,000 beds of the normal 100,000 beds to ensure we've got infection control in place, we've got large numbers of staff self-isolating, we do have growing numbers of staff off with stress and we're now at peak summer leave. 'What trust chief executives are saying to us is that if you add all of that together and you have a 'pressureometer' where you measure the total pressure, what they're saying to us is in many cases this now feels as busy as it did and as pressured as it did in January. 'The shape of the pressure just looks very different.' Up to 40% of 'Covid hospital patients' infected with Delta variant may have been admitted for a different illness, official figures suggest  Four out of 10 patients hospitalised with the Indian Covid variant in England may have been admitted for something else, MailOnline analysis of official data suggests.  Public Health England's fortnightly report on the 'Delta' strain showed a total of 1,904 people had spent at least one night in hospital with the mutant virus by June 21. But the agency admits 739 (39 per cent) of these patients may have gone to hospital for a different condition or injury and tested positive through routine NHS testing. Experts said the findings show that a significant number of the Covid admissions reported by the Government every day will be 'incidental cases'.   Cambridge University epidemiologist Dr Raghib Ali and Dr Simon Clarke, a microbiologist at Reading University, told MailOnline that this will become more common as the outbreak grows. Officials expect there to be at least 100,000 Covid infections per day by next month. There are still some patients who fall gravely ill with the virus and do not get tested until they arrive at hospital, Dr Raghib said, but this is happening less often now that testing is so widespread.  Fewer people are becoming severely ill thanks to the vaccines. Professor Paul Hunter, an expert in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that by next winter 'most cases admitted with a positive test will not be admitted because of Covid'.  PHE's figures also show that of the Indian variant patients who presented at A&E by June 21, just over three in 10 spent the night in hospital, with the rest sent home on the same day. The promising stats come amid growing anecdotal reports of hospital Covid patients having milder symptoms than in previous waves, due to vaccines and the fact younger people now make up a greater proportion of cases. Public Health England's fortnightly report on the 'Delta' strain showed a total of 1,904 people had spent at least one night in hospital with the mutant virus by June 21. But the agency admits 739 (39 per cent) of these patients may have gone to hospital for a different condition or injury and tested positive through routine NHS testing PHE's figures also show that of the Indian variant patients who presented at A&E by June 21, just over three in 10 spent the night in hospital, with the rest sent home on the same day Professor Clarke said MailOnline's analysis highlighted the need to be wary of using general hospital admission figures as an indicator of how much severe disease is being caused by Covid.  'It's detecting the proportion of Covid in society, but what it's doing is meaning the total number of admissions is not a good indicator of the disease burden. 'And that is reflected in the low number of people who are going into intensive care [compared to general admissions].'  Dr Ali said the PHE data provided 'some evidence that there are a higher proportion of patients now that have Covid as an incidental finding' than in previous waves. The fact there is far more testing now than ever before — roughly a million swabs are deployed daily now compared to 400,000 in winter — means it's a 'reasonable assumption' that more incidental cases will be picked up in the NHS.  Professor Hunter said this will become more of an issue if community transmission continues to increase. He told MailOnline: 'There is no doubt that the overall figures on hospitalisation will include cases who just happen to be positive and are picked up by routine screening when they are admitted for something else.  'This will become more of an issue as more people have mild or asymptomatic infections as a result of vaccination or prior infection.' Like Dr Ali, Professor Hunter warned that disentangling the primary cause of admission among Covid hospital patients was difficult. 'It's difficult to know for sure, sometimes even in an individual patient. For example, take someone who has been admitted following a car crash and tests positive. Did they crash because the were driving when not well? 'This is more likely to be an issue in younger people and children where a higher proportion of admissions with a positive test may not be admitted because of the disease. It's also more likely in the vaccinated. 'I suspect in a year or so most cases admitted with a positive test will not be admitted because of Covid.' Hospitals are still required to separate any patient who tests positive, no matter what condition they were primarily admitted for, which puts extra pressure on the NHS.    Stringent infection control measures and repeated lockdowns during the pandemic have led to a record waiting list of 5.3million in England.    PHE said that of the 1,904 Indian variant patients, it was confident 1,165 were admitted primarily for Covid. The other 739 patients tested positive for the virus for the first time on the same day they were admitted. The agency said it separated these patients in its reporting to 'help remove cases picked up via routine testing in healthcare settings whose primary cause of attendance is not COVID-19'. It added: 'Some of the cases detected on the day of admission may have attended for a diagnosis unrelated to Covid.'    Over half of Covid hospitalisations only tested positive AFTER admission

23," Steerpike Five experts who predicted daily Covid cases would hit 100,000 A lot was said and written about the UK's decision to press ahead with July 19, the so-called 'Freedom Day' when restrictions on social contact were lifted. Some greeted this date with a mix of horror, outrage and fury with 1,200 scientists signing a letter which effectively declared the unlocking as 'a threat to the world.' Much of the commentary focused on claims that there would be 100,000 positive Covid tests a day by July 19 and that a mass unlocking would only increase this. The full effect of the unlocking will only be seen in the fortnight after July 19 and the possibility remains that case numbers will go back up again – as they have done all too often before. Mercifully though this has not been the case so far, with the numbers for today – 21 July – showing 23,511 positive test results and a seven day figure of 229,828 – a fall of 102,240 or 30.8 per cent from the previous week. Reasons suggested thus far for the fall include school holidays cancelling out the effects of unlocking and that the earlier July spike was caused by mingling for the Euro 2020 tournament. Still, given the airtime given to those critical voices in the media, whose projections have at times been reported fairly uncritically, Mr S thought it worth rounding up four academics (and one politician) whose predications for late July will (hopefully) remain well wide of the mark. Professor Anthony Costello – 12 June After Freedom Day was pushed back from 20 June to 19 July, academics on Independent SAGE predicted the number of cases would sky-rocket, regardless. ISAGE member Anthony Costello, of University College London, said the true daily infection figure was likely more than double the 8,000 recorded in tests, telling the Daily Mirror: 'In a month you'll be up to 100,000 new cases a day. If the Government takes a gamble and lets rip like Tory backbenchers want, the NHS will be overloaded. Let's wait. Let's stay as we are.'  Professor Christina Pagel – 2 July Another member of Independent SAGE who told the New Scientist: ‘I don’t think I can be a safe member of society when we have 100,000 cases a day.’ She later wrote a piece for the Guardian headed ‘Boris Johnson gave two reasons for lifting all restrictions. Both are wrong’ in which she claimed: ‘cases will keep rising, currently doubling every fortnight or so, until either population immunity is high enough or public health measures are effective enough – or a combination of both – to halt Covid’s spread.’ Pagel projected on July 2 a 70 per cent growth in cases, which would mean a ‘90K seven-day average’ ‘100K cases a day by 19 July.’ As it transpired, less than three weeks later, the seven-day average on Freedom Day was 41,302 with 34,245 new cases that day.     Dr Susan Hopkins – 11 July The Public Health England member told Times Radio that the UK's coronavirus third wave was 'three doubling times away from the peak, unless something changes' just eight days before Freedom Day. This would have potentially meant more than 200,000 cases a day within six weeks, by the end of August. She added that no one could 'ringingly endorse' the decision to lift all restrictions and the country had to be braced for them to return at short notice if hospital admissions rose too much. Professor Neil Ferguson – 18 July The Imperial academic known simply as ‘Professor Lockdown’ appeared on the BBC a day before restrictions were lifted to warn of impending doom. He told Andrew Marr: ‘I think 100,000 cases a day is almost inevitable’ adding: ‘I think it’s almost certain we’ll get through 1,000 hospitalisations per day; it’ll almost certainly get to 100,000 cases a day. The real question is: do we get to double that or even higher? And that’s where the crystal ball starts to fail. I mean we could get to 2,000 hospitalisations a day, 200,000 cases a day but it’s much less certain.’ He concluded that, at that level, which was roughly half the level of Christmas 2020, there would be major disruptive of services and cancellations of elective surgery.  Sir Keir Starmer – 19 July The fence-straddler-in-chief has been careful to avoid overreaching himself against Johnson, leaving other Labour outriders to make stronger attacks against the government. Nevertheless, it was just eight days ago the Leader of the Opposition claimed: 'Lifting all restrictions in one go is reckless and doing so when the Johnson Variant is clearly out of control risks a summer of chaos...This will not be Freedom Day for the 100,000 people per day catching Covid and the millions more being asked to isolate. The Government has, once again, lost control of the virus.’   Let's hope such predictions continue to be disproved by good news in the future.

24," COVID-19: Data shows vaccines reduce risk of hospitalisation and death - but you need to read it with a clear head However, of those dying of COVID-19 in recent months, a comfortable majority - around 64% - had received at least a single dose of one of the vaccines. 
          Economics & data editor
              @EdConwaySky
 Wednesday 28 July 2021 07:01, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Let's begin with a statistic that might surprise you, and possibly alarm you. Of those dying of COVID-19 in recent months, a comfortable majority - around 64% - had received at least a single dose of one of the vaccines. It is there in black and white on Public Health England's data tables: of the 460 people who died between February and July having tested positive for the Delta variant, 289 had been double-jabbed; some 65 had received one dose. And 165 had not been vaccinated at all. Does this mean the vaccines aren't doing what we expected? Not necessarily. To see why, it's worth delving into the PHE numbers, but before doing so, keep in your mind two critical points. The first is that the majority of UK adults have now been vaccinated. Indeed, break it down by age group and you'll see that of those aged over 50 around 91% have been vaccinated - most of them with two jabs. The second is that the vaccines don't entirely reduce the risk of either catching the disease or being hospitalised or dying of it. They are not 100% effective. But they do, at least on the basis of tests from Pfizer and AstraZeneca, reduce the likelihood of both of these outcomes considerably.   But reducing something considerably is not the same as eliminating it. So, for instance, before getting vaccinated the chances of a 90-year-old catching and dying of COVID-19 were estimated to be roughly 2.8%.

                  US First Lady Jill Biden tests positive for COVID
                 After getting the jabs, the chances of the same illustrative 90-year-old catching and dying the disease are reduced to around 0.14%. It's a very big reduction, but that jabbed 90-year-old nonetheless faces a roughly similar risk profile as an unjabbed 60-year-old (0.12%). Same thing for an 80-year-old, whose jabbed risk profile is close to that of an unjabbed 50-year-old. And so on. The point here is that even if the vaccines were doing exactly what we expected of them, some people, especially the elderly, are still quite likely to die of COVID-19 - especially if there's a lot of it around. So what does the actual real-world evidence tell us is going on? Well for this let's refer to the PHE data on the Delta variant. This is the same dataset that Sir Patrick Vallance was referring to when he said the other week that around 60% of those hospitalised were unvaccinated.* It gives us data on a large number of people who tested positive for the Delta variant, and then shows us what happened to each of them next. Here's what we learn from it. Of the over-50s who caught Delta, around 13,700 had been vaccinated at least once; around 2,400 had not been vaccinated. So: that's about 85% of those catching the virus being double-jabbed, which is a little higher than one would expect, but might be a result of this data sample not covering all cases. Either way, the most important thing is what happened next. Consider hospitalisations. Of the vaccinated people, some 3.5% were hospitalised. Of the unvaccinated people, some 8.4% were hospitalised. In other words, the rate of hospitalisations per case was 2.4 times higher among those who were unvaccinated. But here's the crucial thing: because there are so many more people who are vaccinated than unvaccinated (13,700 vs 2,400 in terms of those catching Delta in this sample), the actual number of these over 50-year-olds going into hospital was higher: 487 vaccinated vs 196 unvaccinated. Or consider deaths. Of the vaccinated people who had caught Delta, around 2% sadly died. Of the unvaccinated people who had caught delta, around 5.6% died. Deaths-per-case among the unvaccinated were almost three times higher than in the vaccinated group. It's worth emphasising that, as I say, while this dataset is comprehensive, it may not be representative of the population. So I'd be wary of reading too much into the comparative ratios here, or trying to calculate an effectiveness figure from them. Even so: this is real-world data and it suggests a very strong reduction of mortality among those who have been vaccinated. Yet because of the sheer numbers of those who are vaccinated, despite this comparative reduction in mortality, the simple total number of those dying is 279 vaccinated compared with 131 unvaccinated. From the beginning of this pandemic it's been very easy to take figures out of context - whether to alarm people or to delude them. This is another one of those instances where context is phenomenally important.   The vaccines are reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death from COVID-19. It is there in the data - provided you read it with a clear head. *You might recall Sir Patrick said that around 60% of those hospitalised were double jabbed in the press conference, and then had to correct himself on Twitter afterwards. Interestingly, when you look just at the over-50s, it turns out around 54% of those admitted were indeed double-jabbed, with only 29% of those admitted having had no vaccination. Again, given the very high proportions of those in the age group who are vaccinated, this is perhaps unsurprising.

25," Intended for healthcare professionals Search form Covid-19: China stymies investigation into pandemic’s origins Read our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Prospects for a serious accounting of the origins of the covid-19 pandemic seemed more distant than ever this week, as the US and China traded barbs at a high level diplomatic meeting on 26 July, after China’s apparent refusal to countenance any further investigation in Wuhan by the World Health Organization. The theory that the novel coronavirus escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology has gained ground in recent months,1 not least because of suspicions generated by the extreme reticence of China’s government. But the question has also become entangled in US politics, as last week a Republican senator, Rand Paul of Kentucky, accused the US National Institutes of Health of funding “gain of function” research (that which alters an organism or disease to increase pathogenesis, transmissibility, or host range) into bat coronaviruses that might have made them transmissible to humans. In a fractious televised exchange, Paul accused President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, of lying to Congress. In a May hearing Fauci told Congress that the NIH “has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research” at the Wuhan Institute. The senator, who has clashed with Fauci repeatedly in hearings on the pandemic, asked him on 20 July, “Dr Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of 11 May where you claimed that the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?” The NIH “has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research” at the Chinese laboratory, Fauci replied. “I have never lied before the Congress, and I do not retract that statement,” he said, adding that the research had been “judged by qualified staff up and down the chain as not being gain-of-function.” “You are implying that what we did was responsible for the deaths of individuals,” Fauci said. “I totally resent that. And if anybody’s lying here, Senator, it is you.” It was “molecularly impossible” that the viruses created in the NIH sponsored research had evolved into the pandemic coronavirus, added Fauci. Experts generally agree with that assessment, but some worry that it does not rule out the possibility of a wild bat virus being brought into circulation through the laboratory’s activities, noting the extraordinary coincidence that a pandemic that was based on a bat coronavirus should begin in a city with a laboratory that specialises in bat coronaviruses. WHO doubts emerge An initial report from a WHO team sent to Wuhan struck many observers as premature in stating that a laboratory leak origin was “extremely unlikely.”2 That conclusion was criticised by WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who said on 15 July that there had been a “premature push” to rule out the leak theory. “I was a lab technician myself, I’m an immunologist, and I have worked in the lab, and lab accidents happen,” Tedros said. “It’s common.” He told reporters that WHO was “asking China to be transparent, open and to cooperate, especially on the information, [the] raw data that we asked for in the early days of the pandemic.” Records of meetings at the Geneva agency in the pandemic’s first days, obtained by the Associated Press last year, suggest that WHO leaders’ early praise of Chinese transparency was an effort to coax more information from the regime, while among themselves they expressed frustration at its secrecy. Emergencies director Michael Ryan, who leads WHO’s covid-19 response, privately compared China’s behaviour unfavourably to the Democratic Republic of Congo’s transparency over Ebola virus disease and noted that China had also delayed the release of vital information during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003.3 China’s government initially hoped that the pandemic would boost China’s reputation as it provided the developing world with cheap vaccines and showcased its own tight infection control. But a recent poll in several countries showed that China’s public image has taken a hit.4 Chinese vaccines, meanwhile, have been troubled by slow deliveries and limited efficacy. A Chinese official last week dismissed WHO’s plan for a second phase to its Wuhan investigation. “It is impossible for us to accept such an origin tracing plan,” said Zeng Yixin, the vice minister of the National Health Commission, suggesting that WHO should instead investigate the United States. China’s government has lent support to a conspiracy theory that blames the pandemic on the US military.5 “Their position is irresponsible and, frankly, dangerous,” the White House said in response. “This is about saving lives in the future, and it’s not a time to be stonewalling.” Biden has ordered US intelligence services to prepare an assessment on the leak theory. They are due to report back in late August.

26," CBD Oil UK laws for 2022 - what Is CBD and is it legal? Free Period Products Scotland: First in the world period products law comes into force in Scotland Covid Scotland: Nicola Sturgeon attacks critics of vaccine rollout and questions intelligence of opposition Nicola Sturgeon has issued a fierce rebuke to critics of the vaccination rollout, claiming she assumed a “certain level of intelligence” among those listening to her. Sign up to our public interest bulletins - get the latest news on the Coronavirus comments Her comments follow accusations the Scottish Government had failed to meet the First Minister’s pledge made in Holyrood of having “given” two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine to all 40-49 year-olds by Monday. Admitting she was going on a “rant”, Ms Sturgeon accused opposition politicians and journalists of not having a “certain level of intelligence” and failing to “attach context and common sense” to her words. Sign up to our public interest bulletins - get the latest news on the Coronavirus The response was labelled a “Trump-style meltdown for the ages” by the Scottish Conservatives, who have also written to Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone asking her to ensure Ms Sturgeon “admits that her original statement was misleading”. Read More  Speaking at a Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday, the First Minister appeared irritated by a line of questioning around whether the Scottish Government had hit its milestone of giving second doses to all 40-49 year-olds following a statement to that effect in Parliament last month. As of Tuesday, 77.3 per cent of that age group has had two doses. Uptake is also slipping in younger age groups, with 19.4 per cent of 30 to 39-year-olds and 28.3 per cent of 18 to 29-year-olds not in receipt of a single jab. Asked whether similar milestones for those younger age groups to be given two doses by mid-August and mid-September respectively were set to be met, Ms Sturgeon took aim at journalists and opposition politicians. She said: “I kind of communicate at a level where I assume a certain level of intelligence on the part of people listening to me because I think that's justified. ""And I assume a certain ability to attach context and common sense to what I am saying.” The First Minister clarified that her statement had meant all adults would be “offered” the vaccine, rather than having jabs in arms. She said: “All I would say is if that is genuinely what people – journalists, opposition politicians – thought I meant, and that I had committed to that, without compulsory vaccination, I'm genuinely really surprised that there wasn't a clamour of questions … asking me how I was going to deliver that commitment. “Surely we should all try to have grown up, sophisticated nuanced discussions, and the most important thing right now is not getting into some kind of 'dancing on the head of a pin' debate about what I meant when I used a particular word.” The Scottish Conservatives were heavily critical of the First Minister following the briefing, stating her “hostile performance treats the public like fools”. Party health spokesperson Annie Wells said: “Question after question at Tuesday’s Covid briefing got the full Nicola Sturgeon condescending eyeroll treatment. “In a Trump-style meltdown for the ages, the First Minister claimed she was communicating at a more intelligent, higher level than the rest of us. “This kind of hostile performance treats the public like fools. “Her defence for missing a key vaccine target seems to be that nobody understands Nicola except Nicola. “People hoping for answers to serious questions instead got a truly bizarre rant. She talked down to us mere mortals because we had the audacity to believe she had meant what she said in the Scottish Parliament.” Want to join the conversation?

27,"  Half of hospitalised Covid patients develop a complication, including young and otherwise healthy people, according to a new study By Carolyn L. Todd A large study published this month adds to the concerning body of research on Coronavirus complications and health effects. According to the new research that includes data for more than 70,000 UK patients, half of all people hospitalised with Covid-19 will be diagnosed with at least one complication. For the study, published in The Lancet, researchers collected data on 73,197 hospitalised Covid-19 patients over the age of 19 across 302 hospitals in the UK between January 17th and August 4th 2020. Most of the people in the study were male (56%) and white (73.5%). They were also older (with an average age of 71) and likely to have at least one underlying condition (81%), like diabetes, heart disease, or lung disease. By Natalie Smith The researchers looked at how many of these patients were diagnosed with at least one complication — affecting organs and systems like the kidneys, heart, and respiratory system — during their hospital stay. The overall complication rate was 49.7%, meaning that just about half of the Covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital in this study developed at least one complication. (Nearly one-third, 31.5%, of all those admitted died, but among patients who survived, the complication rate was still quite high at 43.5%.) By far, the most common frequent complications were renal (namely kidney failure), which were diagnosed in 24.3% of people overall. Complex respiratory complications (including bacterial pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and collapsed lung) were also common and developed in 18.4% of patients. Systemic complications (such as blood clotting disorders) affected 16.3% of patients. Cardiovascular issues (like blood clots, heart failure, and arrhythmia) occurred in 12.3% of people; neurological complications (including meningitis and brain swelling) in 4.3% of people; and GI/liver issues (like liver failure and GI bleeding) in 10.8% of people. By Ali Pantony Not everyone was equally likely to develop a complication. People with more severe cases of Covid-19 were at a higher risk, with 82.4% of those who received critical care and 91.7% of those who received invasive mechanical ventilation also developing at least one complication. Researchers also found that increasing age, male sex, and underlying conditions were all factors tied to a greater likelihood of experiencing complications (after adjusting for factors like socioeconomic status). The people most likely to experience complications were patients ages 60 to 69 who had at least two underlying conditions: 57.9% of them were diagnosed with at least one complication. But complications were also relatively common in the youngest and healthiest patients. For instance, even though individuals ages 19 to 29 with no co-morbid conditions were the group least likely to have complications, 21.2% of them—about one in five—still had at least one complication. Unsurprisingly, people who already had a health condition affecting a particular organ were much more likely to develop a complication affecting that organ. For instance, people with chronic kidney disease had a 39.8% chance of suffering from kidney failure, compared to 21.6% of people who did not have chronic kidney disease. Similarly, people who had heart disease were over twice as likely to develop a cardiac complication as people without heart disease (19.9% vs. 8.9%). And 22.4% of patients with moderate-to-severe liver disease suffered a liver injury, vs. 6.2% of patients without liver disease. By Ali Pantony While it's clear that Covid-19 can often have severe impacts on a wide array of systems in the body, there is still a lot that researchers have yet to understand about how exactly the virus causes these widespread health effects. Previous studies looking at a broad range of long-term health issues that linger or develop weeks or months after a Covid-19 infection (sometimes called long Covid) have also found them to be relatively common. While this new research didn't capture long-term outcomes, it did find that people who were diagnosed with complications during their hospital stay were much more likely to have a reduced capacity to take care of themselves upon discharge (and a greater need for ongoing care). But as the authors note, we need more research to fully understand how these immediate Covid-19 complications may impact people's health in the long term.

28," Leeds care home ravaged by Covid was issued safety warning days before first lockdown It has recorded more coronavirus deaths than any other care home in Yorkshire Get the latest news from all parts of our city - sign up for our free email newsletter Thank you for subscribing! We have more newsletters A care home that has recorded more Covid-19 deaths than any other in Yorkshire was told it needed to improve its services just days before the first lockdown. Colton Lodges Care Home, a 138-bed care home in Leeds, provides specialist dementia care to residents aged 65 and over. It saw 31 residents die with the virus during the first year of the pandemic, almost a third of the 108 people living there at the time of the inspection. READ MORE: Live updates as 'unexploded bomb' found near train tracks A spokesperson for Colton Lodges said ""every death is a tragedy"", but noted the majority of deaths came when transmission rates were exceptionally high and before the rollout of regular testing in care settings. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) carried out an unannounced visit at the care home on March 5, 2020 - just a fortnight before England was plunged into lockdown for the first time. The care home, which is managed by HC-One, was handed a rating of 'requires improvement' and concerns were raised around safety, responsiveness and leadership.  ""There was an increased risk that people could be harmed,"" read the report. ""Service management and leadership was inconsistent, records were not accurate or completed [and] governance systems were not robust."" In the weeks following the CQC inspection, Covid-19 ripped through the care home. CQC All bar one of the 31 deaths came in the first three months of lockdown between April 10 and June, 2020. The only other death linked to Covid-19 was in the period between January and March this year. No other care home in Yorkshire saw more deaths linked to coronavirus during the first year of the pandemic. In fact, it was one of the 10 worst affected care homes in the north of England. Colton Lodges says it is now ""safe of coronavirus"" and has produced an infection control guide which states ""enhanced infection control measures are paramount to all aspects of the care services we offer"".

Send your footage via WhatsApp to 07785 476084 A spokesperson for Colton Lodges said: “Every death is a tragedy for the individual’s family and is also deeply felt by our colleagues. Residents and their families become part of our extended family over the time they live with us and our thoughts and sympathies are with all families who have lost a loved one from coronavirus.  “The past 17 months have been an exceptionally difficult time for everyone working in and connected to Colton Lodges. “Throughout the pandemic we have worked tirelessly to protect our residents and colleagues. This includes taking steps to ensure all of our homes were following the government’s guidance at every stage, focusing on the highest standards of infection control, making sure we were using the recommended PPE, utilising all opportunities to participate in testing and supporting the vaccine rollout. “Despite these measures, sadly our outbreak took place at a time when community transmission rates were high and before the introduction of the more regular testing programme or vaccine programme, both of which have become the best defences we have. As we move forward, we continue to be exceptionally vigilant, especially as lockdown measures continue to ease. “We are exceptionally grateful for the ongoing support and understanding of our residents and their loved ones, and we are very proud of how our team rose to the challenges of working on the front lines of the pandemic over the last 17 months.” The CQC said its inspectors have been constantly engaging with providers and monitoring services throughout the pandemic. Damning reports last year uncovered how some care homes were told to welcome back residents who had tested positive for Covid-19. More than 40,000 people in the care sector have died with Covid-19 in England, with critics slamming procedures during the first lockdown. At the start of the pandemic, some hospital patients were discharged into care homes despite testing positive, while others weren't tested at all. Kate Terroni, CQC’s chief inspector of adult social care, said: “In considering this data it is important to remember that every number represents a life lost – and families, friends and those who cared for them who are having to face the sadness and consequences of their death.” She said the figures aimed to provide a more comprehensive picture of the impact of Covid-19 on care homes, the people living in them and their families.  Ms Terroni added: “It is important to be clear, however, that although this data relates to deaths of people who were care home residents, many of them did not die in or contract Covid-19 in a care home.” The data provided to the CQC is the total number of death notifications by care home providers involving Covid-19, where the deaths have been either suspected or confirmed Covid-19 regardless of where the death occurred. In some instances, residents may have contracted coronavirus elsewhere.

 A data breach in the Covid vaccine passport scheme has seen some people being sent other applicants’ personal information. Officials said the Northern Ireland Covid-19 Certification Service – COVIDCert NI – has experienced a technical difficulty and availability will be temporarily interrupted. The Department of Health (DoH) said it is aware that a limited number of users may be presented with data relating to other users. Immediate action has also been taken to temporarily remove a part of the service that manages identity. Breaking down who is affected the DoH explained: A spokesperson for the DoH said it takes the privacy of citizen’s data very seriously and contact has been made with the Information Commissioner’s Office as part of due diligence in protecting citizen’s data. “The department is endeavouring to resolve the issue and will provide a further update as soon as responsibly possible,” the DoH said.

31," France and UK's amber travel list hope: 'New' Covid Beta data mystery 
Nothing new in available data on the variant in France suggests a change in the variant’s prevalence in the past week - yet a ‘recovery’ is being reported
 The UK moved France to a special amber plus travel list over concerns of the prevalence of the Beta variant of Covid-19, a concern not shared by France's own health authorities Pic: Jarun Ontakrai / Shutterstock France is expected to move from the UK’s amber plus travel list back to the regular amber list as early as next week, it is widely reported in the British press. The change will mean there is no longer a need for visiting Britons to France to self-isolate for 10 days on return, although this only applies to people vaccinated against Covid-19 in the UK.  The Times reported that UK “government officials appeared to acknowledge the threat from the Beta variant of the coronavirus had been contained” in France and hence will place the country back on ‘amber’.  The Financial Times reported that senior government ministers were preparing to put France back on the regular amber list “as the Delta variant replaces the Beta strain as the most dominant form of the virus”. Florence Débarre, a scientist and researcher at France’s national research centre, the Centre national de la recherche scientifique, said that this was false and that the Beta variant has never been dominant on mainland France, at any point.  She told The Connexion it was difficult to understand the UK’s decision to put France specifically on the amber plus list.  She said the only reliable way to track the variant was through a technique called sequencing, and some of France’s latest sequencing data has contained errors, “which distort the estimates”. It means it is hard to know exactly how many cases of Beta there are in France currently.  What is known is that the Beta variant did not appear as a concern in any official communication from France’s health bodies at that time the UK moved France to its amber plus list - and has not been highlighted as a concern since. The UK dropped the need for fully vaccinated travellers in the UK and who enter from any of its amber-listed countries, to quarantine on arrival, on July 19. France, though, was placed on a new special ‘amber-plus’ list to which the exemption from quarantine did not apply. The government attributed this decision to the spread of the Beta variant of Covid in France, first identified in South Africa.  “The Joint Biosecurity Centre assessed that France is a high-risk Covid-19 destination due to the circulation of variants of concern, most notably the Beta variant, which is the variant that presents the greatest risk for vaccine escape,” a UK government statement says.  It adds, “the decision to add countries to the Red, Amber or Green lists is made jointly by ministers, informed by the latest scientific data and public health advice and taking into account a range of factors.” We look at recent data on the Beta variant in France to see what it reveals. The Beta variant is considered the majority strain in the overseas department of Réunion, located some 9,000km from Paris. It is, though, said to be “circulating at a low level” in mainland France. A July 6 report by the official Conseil scientifique, which advises the French government on the pandemic, put rates of the Beta variant for the whole of France at 9%, which includes Réunion. This has since dropped to possibly under 3%, according to UK media reports, which claim that this drop is the reason France may now be returned to the UK’s amber list. However, the proportion is not the same as the number of cases, Ms Débarre told The Connexion. “There is often confusion between the proportion of cases and the number of cases,” she said. “The proportion of Beta is effectively going down because the number of cases of Delta is increasing,” she said. This does not mean the actual number of cases of Beta is decreasing in France. France is using two techniques to track variants. One is screening, where positive Covid samples are checked for specific mutations that are commonly found in variants. Through this technique, France is tracking the presence of the E484K mutation, which is found in the Beta variant, but also the Gamma and Alpha variants.  This means that even if France finds fewer samples with the E484K mutation through screening, it does not strictly mean the number of Beta cases has dropped, as it could be that the number of Gamma or Alpha cases have dropped.  Ms Débarre said that it was not possible to tell with this data alone whether the number of Beta cases was increasing or decreasing.  She said that the other technique of tracking variants - called sequencing - is the only reliable way to know how many cases of Beta there are in France. This is where scientists can analyse positive Covid samples and see every possible mutation in the sample. But Ms Débarre said that the Institut Méditerranée Infection in Marseille, a main sequencing hub in France, has had issues submitting accurate data, “which distort the estimates”, and in general results arrive with delays. The UK government told The Connexion it is using GISAID, a data initiative that monitors Covid-19 globally in real-time, for data regarding the Beta variant in France. It collects sequencing data, submitted by countries from around the world.  The UK government states that GISAID shows that as of July 19, France has recorded a total of 2,959 cases of Beta (5.2% of all cases) since the beginning of 2021. This is compared to 1,052 cases in the UK (0.2% of total cases).  Ms Débarre told The Connexion in a separate interview last week that this number is accurate, based on the sequencing results that France has submitted to GISAID, but is not completely helpful.  “The problem is, this number does not mean anything in itself, because it depends on how many tests are sequenced. It is also dependent on the proportion of cases compared to the population,” she said. “Other countries in Europe have a lot of cases of Beta too, such as Luxembourg and Finland. “So why has France been singled out in particular by the UK? I do not know,” she said.  The number also only identifies the total number of cases of the Beta variant that France has found through sequencing and uploaded to GISAID since the beginning of 2021. It offers no indication as to how many active cases of Beta there are in France currently.  France is known to be far behind the UK in terms of its sequencing capacity. It is therefore very hard to know exactly how many cases of Beta there are in France at this time.  It means that if the UK government was concerned about the prevalence of Beta in France based on data on July 16 when it announced it was placing France on its amber plus list, then there is no reason that there should be less concern based on data available today.  However, politics could also play a role in the decision-making process.  Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s Europe minister, reportedly told the UK’s foreign secretary Dominic Raab in a meeting in Paris yesterday (July 26) that there was no basis for keeping France on the amber plus list. ABTA, a leading association of travel agents and tour operators in the UK, also expressed its disappointment at the UK’s decision on July 16.  “While we understand that public health must come first, this announcement will undoubtedly dent consumer confidence in overseas travel just as we are about to see many amber-listed countries opening up for UK visitors in time for the summer holidays,” a spokesperson for the organisation said.

32," The British government’s Covid strategy was never designed to manage the virus An illusion of incompetence and ignorance has allowed No 10 to exploit the pandemic for economic and political gain Since the announcement of the removal of all Covid-related restrictions in England, experts have warned of disastrous consequences, from the inevitable spike in cases to new variants emerging. We can hope the government will eventually recognise the public health risks and put some of these measures back into place. However, power and cronyism – and not health needs – are likely to drive any such decision. As the last 18 months have shown, the British government’s Covid-19 strategy was never designed to manage the virus. For all the talk of “following the science”, No 10’s use of scientific evidence has been adjusted to its policy preferences throughout. The effectiveness of masks in preventing transmission was acknowledged only in the summer of 2020, despite World Health Organization (WHO) guidance earlier in the year. Ventilation only recently became part of public health guidance in England, despite sustained evidence of aerosol transmission. The UK’s continued insistence on fever, cough, and the loss of smell and taste as symptoms of coronavirus stands in tension with research on asymptomatic infections and emerging evidence suggesting loss of smell and taste may not be as common with the Delta variant. Other scientific evidence the government has been reluctant to acknowledge is that, while vaccines may be very efficient in preventing the worst outcomes – hospitalisation and death – vaccinated people can still contract and transmit Covid-19. This raises important moral and ethical questions about the effects of placing large numbers of unmasked people into small, poorly ventilated spaces without social distancing, such as public transport or nightclubs. It may be tempting to explain the government’s lagging public health advice by a lack of clear evidence, the novelty of the situation, or just “bad luck”. But this obscures the degree to which the government has also exploited the uncertainty generated by the Covid-19 pandemic for economic and political gain, by using the facade of incompetence to narrow the political choices available to the public. In a report released last December, the cross-party joint committee on national security strategy condemned the government for having “failed seriously to consider how it might scale up testing, isolation and contact-tracing capabilities during a serious disease outbreak”. But the report missed a key aspect: the delay in scaling up public testing helped to prime the space for private UK-based firms to enter the market. In January 2020, the UK passed on the early chance to use a viral sequence developed by a German lab and made freely available by the WHO to make a Covid test. It did, however, award last-minute public contracts for testing, tracing, and the production of PPE and ventilators to companies with little or no prior experience in similar tasks. The illusion of incompetence also obscures the government’s responsibility for creating the conditions that contributed to the crisis in the first place. While other countries were rolling out testing, the British government was liaising with executives at Serco, Deloitte and other private firms – and instructing individual NHS trusts to stop purchasing ventilators or their own PPE until a centralised system run by Deloitte was operational. Subsequent reporting has revealed links between companies that were awarded contracts and the Conservative party. By allowing the virus to replicate, the government contributed to its spread. Yet this governing approach, which we call “fatalistic liberalism”, allows it to place the blame on the mix of public behaviour and natural causes. Risk appears to be the consequence of personal choice – people can decide whether to wear a mask or whether to get vaccinated – not the result of policy decisions made at the top. The twin alibis of incompetence and ignorance enable politicians to deny responsibility for the consequences of their own inaction. If, as the head of NHS test and trace, Dido Harding argued, no one could have predicted the virus would mutate, then no one can be held accountable for the surge in infections and the inevitable harms created by the removal of masks and social distancing. This fatalistic approach to managing public risk is reflected in Johnson’s statement, “We need to learn to live with the virus.” But the government’s strategy is not about teaching people to live with the virus; it’s teaching people to accept that the lives of many of them are not worth saving. In this sense, the choice the British people have is not whether they want to live with the virus – it’s whether they want to live with a government that sees them as chesspieces on an invisible board in a game that it pretends no one is playing.

Number of Covid cases rises, bucking the recent downward trend 718 cases have been reported in the last 24 hours Covid-19 cases on the Balearic Islands as of July 27. | www.caib.es The Regional Ministry of Health today reported 718 new cases of Covid in 24 hours and one new death was also reported while the number of patients with coronavirus admitted to intensive care units (ICU) rose to 50. As reported by the government in the space of 24 hours the number of patients in intensive care rose from 46 to fifty, which means that 18% of the beds in these units are dedicated to covid-19, and on the wards there are 305 patients with coronavirus, 17 more than the day before. The total increase of hospitalised patients is 6.2 %, the positive rate of diagnostic tests on Monday was 13.7 % and the official death toll now stands at 856. The total number of covid patients being treated by the Health Service today was 11,396, which represented a daily increase of 7%. The accumulated incidence in 14 days is 923 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the islands as a whole, with a particularly high incidence in Ibiza, where it reached 1,544, followed by Mallorca, with 833, Minorca, with 828 and Formentera, where there have been 680 cases per 100,000 in two weeks. Of the new cases today, 473 have been diagnosed in Mallorca, where 249 people are hospitalised, 35 of them in intensive care, and 8,301 infected people are convalescing at home or in covid hotels set up by the government. In Ibiza, 190 cases of infection were diagnosed, 63 people are in hospital, nine in intensive care and 2,397 under the supervision of primary care. In Minorca 48 new cases were detected, 34 of which are hospitalised, six of them in the ICU, and 613 patients are recovering at home or in their hotels. In Formentera there are seven new cases and 85 patients cared for at home. Today there are 58 nursing home residents infected with coronavirus, as well as residential care 48 workers, while the active positives among health professionals stood at 117. A total of 732,155 people in the Balearic Islands, 70.7 percent, have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. 59.4 percent have received the full vaccination dose. 1,275,921 doses of the vaccine have been administered across the islands, 615,528 of which have has the full dose. By islands, 998,921 doses have been administered in Mallorca, with 574,943 people having received at least one dose and 480,422 the full jab; in Ibiza 155,684 doses have been inoculated, with 88,622 people having received one dose and 76,388 the full course. In Minorca 110,714 doses have been administered (62,180 people have received at least one dose and 53,487, the full dose); and in Formentera 9,978 vaccines have been administered (6,020 people have received at least one dose and 4,940, the full course).

                    Turkey's daily COVID-19 cases near 20,000
                 
															by Daily Sabah
							                             Turkey’s daily coronavirus cases on Tuesday reached the highest figure since early May, with the number of new infections nearing 20,000. According to the Health Ministry data, Turkey recorded 19,761 cases in the past 24 hours, with the daily death toll standing at 51. Tuesday’s figures were the highest number of daily cases since May 7, when Ankara reported 20,107 new infections. The spike in new infections came after the government removed almost all coronavirus restrictions. Turkey’s latest normalization attempt began on July 1, after a 17-day full lockdown and months of nighttime and weekend curfews. A nationwide vaccination campaign pulled down the numbers before most restrictions were lifted in July, about two months after daily cases were around 60,000.  While the country managed to keep the case numbers steady at around 5,000 after the initial weeks of the latest normalization period, infections have been steadily increasing for the past few days. Several experts have voiced concern over the increasing cases, saying the country will have a difficult fall season if the upward trend continues. With the highly infectious delta variant also on the rise across the country, the Health Ministry has placed all its hopes into its ambitious vaccination campaign to keep lockdowns from returning. So far, Turkey has administered over 68.7 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines since the start of its vaccination campaign in January. Nearly 40 million people have gotten their first dose, while over 24.5 million have received their second jabs.","Tue, 27 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/turkeys-daily-covid-19-cases-near-20000/news,"Turkey's daily COVID-19 cases near 20,000 | Daily Sabah - Daily Sabah"

 Team GB Swimmer Tom Dean Got Covid-19 Twice. Then He Won a Gold Medal The Olympic champion says topping the podium is the ""single greatest achievement"" of his life He just became the first British man to win an Olympic freestyle title in 113 years, but at the beginning of 2021, Olympic gold seemed ""a million miles away"" for Tom Dean – after he contracted COVID not once, but twice. The 21-year-old swimmer was first consigned to isolation in September 2020, only to be struck down by a second bout of the virus in January, putting his first appearance at the Olympic Games in doubt.  Despite missing out on almost two months of preparation for the event, Dean recovered in time to head to Tokyo and win the gold ahead of fellow Team GB swimmer Duncan Scott, who took the second spot on the podium in a rare British one-two.    ""I contracted COVID twice in the last 12 months, six or seven weeks out during an Olympic year, which is essentially unheard of,"" Dean told the BBC. ""I had it in September and then the New Year. The first time was not too bad but the second time I was really ill. It was quite severe. (continued below) 
  ""I did the full isolation period so two or three months out from our Olympic trials in April, I'm stuck inside, unable to even exercise inside my own flat. When I was sitting in my flat during Olympic year, an Olympic gold seemed a million miles off."" Dean, whose remarkable time – 1 minute 44.22 seconds – broke the British record for the 200m men's freestyle, said it was ""tough having a long time out of the water"". ""It obviously requires a slow build-up because of the nature of the disease you can’t go straight back into full training,"" he said. ""It was a very bumpy ride. ""It wasn't life-threatening... But when you do a sport that requires so heavily on your cardiovascular system, the disease is affecting your lungs, you're coughing and all that kind of stuff, you're a little bit worried about how you’re going to build back up.""  Dean came second in the Olympic trials, tailing Scott by just 0.11 seconds. But in the final the script was flipped, and Dean secured the gold with a 0.04 second lead. After the race, Scott credited his fellow team-mate's ""unbelievable"" performance, adding that it's ""a pleasure to watch"" how far Dean had come.  ""I'm buzzing for Deano,"" Scott said. ""He's had a really strange 18 months with COVID twice and a monster PB at trials. But to see him move it on again and win gold is phenomenal. Our best possible outcome is one-two and we delivered on that, and I got a PB in the final as well so I'm really happy.""","Tue, 27 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.menshealth.com/uk/fitness/lifestyle/a37140492/team-gb-tom-dean-gold-medal-covid/,Team GB Swimmer Tom Dean Got COVID-19 Twice.

36," Belsonic defends decision for concert-goers to require proof of Covid status Promoter Joe Dougan said the criteria has been introduced to keep the audience, artists and workers safe Get the latest nostalgia features and photo stories from Belfast Nostalgia straight to your inbox Thank you for subscribing! We have more newsletters Belsonic has defended the decision for concert-goers to show proof of their Covid status for gigs in Belfast later this year.  The Belsonic events at Ormeau Park and also CHSQ at Custom House Square, will both require ticket holders to show proof of having had either, both doses of the vaccine, proof of a negative Covid test 48 hours before arrival or proof of natural antibodies.  Belfast Live spoke to Belsonic's Joe Dougan who set out why these entry requirements have been put in place.  He said it's been a long 17 months of not having these events but that ""it's going to be great"". Joe explained: ""Because these shows are all fully outdoor it's something that I guess governments are generally in favour of and I think they are a lot safer than indoor settings as well. ""The experience itself won't be terribly different compared with previous years, really just the only difference compared with say 2019 is the introduction of this additional criteria for entry that we've introduced today. ""What we've introduced is what we call Covid certification. It's three separate ways in which you can prove on entry to the events from a Covid point of view that you're safe. ""The first is that you are double vaccinated and that's something you can prove using your vaccination card, or there are various ways to do that - it's all listed on our website. ""The second is that you've got natural immunity to Covid because you've had it in the last six months, so that's basically a positive PCR test that shows that you've had it and isolated after the period you had it. ""And the third is a lateral flow test which is a really simple, free test that you can do that gets posted out to your house by the government."" Joe said this criteria has been introduced to keep the audience, artists and workers at the concerts safe and to ensure it keeps the industry sustainable. He added: ""But more than anything else, it's probably to safeguard the industry that we work in too, as everybody will be aware it's been a very long time since live music promoters like ourselves have been able to trade and do what we do. ""We want to not only be able to do these events this summer but we want to be able to do events rolling into the winter, next year and certainly next summer as well. ""It's about increasing customer confidence as much as anything else because if you are one of the people concerned from a Covid point of view about attending a concert, this gives you a little bit more peace of mind."" In response to the reaction that Monday's announcement received, Joe added people are mistakenly thinking Belsonic is asking for proof of vaccination for entry only – and the public would not be permitted entry without it. Joe insisted: ""That's not the case, you do not need to be vaccinated to get into one of these shows,"" as you can also show a negative lateral flow test or proof of having coronavirus in the last six months. He added: ""That is not something we ever would have considered introducing as it excludes a lot of people."" For those nervous about getting back into crowds, Belsonic said it will have additional mitigations in place such as hygiene measures and temperature checks to help keep it safe. Joe said: ""People can be assured that if they are attending one of these concerts, that every single person that is on that site, because we will be making sure that the workers do this as well, that they will have either been tested for Covid or that they can demonstrate full vaccination as well."" The music industry worker added he's glad ""everything is moving in the right direction"" following the Executive announcement about the return of live music at indoor venues. He revealed the demand for live music is the highest it has ever been, a sign that everyone is ""raring to go"" which has been reflected in ticket sales. Outdoor concerts upcoming in Belfast include Liam Gallagher, Gerry Cinnamon, Tom Jones, MK and Kodaline.","Tue, 27 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/belfast-news/belsonic-defends-decision-concert-goers-21152375,Belsonic defends decision for concert-goers to require proof of Covid status - Belfast Live
37," Cardiff City hit by four Covid cases and brutal injury list as Kieffer Moore among doubts for season opener The Bluebirds manager revealed that a number of players had contracted Covid and a few stars were touch and go for the new season Get Cardiff City updates sent to your inbox Thank you for subscribing! We have more newsletters Mick McCarthy has revealed the brutal extent of Cardiff City's lengthy injury list and the four key players who are recovering after contracting coronavirus ahead of the new season. The Bluebirds are managing a raft of fitness issues just days out from the new Championship season, while all three players returning from international duty, Kieffer Moore, Rubin Colwill and Leandro Bacuna, are on the mend after contracting coronavirus. It leaves McCarthy sweating on their fitness, given protocols dictate they still cannot train fully, throwing their involvement against Barnsley into doubt given they have had no minutes in their legs in pre-season. Perry Ng is also still working his way back to full tilt after he tested positive for the virus earlier in the summer. Sean Morrison is still recovering from a dislocated elbow, inflicted by Uche Ikpeazu against Wycombe Wanderers at the back end of the season, while Tom Sang (toe), Ryan Wintle (groin) and Isaac Vassell (knee) are all also on the treatment table. In fact, when McCarthy laid out exactly what Cardiff are dealing with at the minute, it paints a pretty bleak picture.  “I loved the atmosphere beforehand but it’s sod’s law – I wouldn’t have picked Southampton [as a first home game],"" McCarthy said after the 4-0 defeat.   “Having won 10, drawn nine and lost four of my first 23 games, I said it would be sod’s law in the first game back with fans that we’d get beaten at home.   “But it’s a great workout. Perry Ng is recovering from Covid – he’s still feeling the effects of that.   “Tom Sang has had to have an injection after his toe surgery. Sean Morrison’s had a dislocated elbow and he’s still recovering from that.   “Joel Bagan had a dislocated shoulder. Rubin and Kieffer have come back from international so they’ve had a break and then they’ve got Covid, so they’re only just back in training.   “Leo Bacuna went away on international duty, again isolating with Covid. Nels has had a hernia operation and Murph has had a hamstring so he’s only trained this week.   “So it was going to be a tough game anyway but, with that list of injuries we’ve got, it doesn’t make it any easier.”  Do you want Cardiff City transfer stories delivered straight to your inbox every day this summer?

""Sean I think will be involved on Saturday [against Newport County].   “Joel’s playing but he’s been out for three months. Nels only played his second game but I’d expect him to be fit. I can’t see Murph being fit.   “Rubin and Kieffer, they’re coming back with protocols at 70 per cent so they can’t train fully.  “We’ll see but I can’t see them all being fit for the first game.”","Wed, 28 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cardiff-city-hit-four-covid-21160836,Cardiff City hit by four Covid cases and brutal injury list as Kieffer Moore among doubts for season opener - Wales Online
38," The one Covid symptom more likely to be found in people who test positive after vaccination Scientists also found people who were jabbed and tested positive had milder symptoms Get the latest Welsh Covid-19 news sent straight to your inbox with the Coronavirus Briefing newsletter Thank you for subscribing! We have more newsletters Vaccines are key to stopping deaths or serious illness and have proven to reduce the number of hospitalisations. Wales' Covid-19 case rate has fallen for a fifth day in a row, with early signs the third wave may have passed its peak. It is the first time we have seen five successive daily falls since early April and it follows a pattern also noticed in England. You can find the latest figures for every area of Wales here. Read more:Mum hit by runaway car as her husband threw daughter, 2, out of the way Almost two million people in Wales have have received their first dose of a coronavirus jab, and 37 million across the UK are fully vaccinated. But while being vaccinated gives you greater protection, you could still contract and pass on the virus - and, if you test positive, you have to self-isolate. New research from the ZOE Covid Symptom study found that vaccinated people who caught the virus reported 'only' one coronavirus symptom which differed from the main ones. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the main signs that you might have contracted Covid have been a high temperature, a new, continuous cough and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. But researchers discovered that sneezing was the ""only"" symptom which was more commonly reported in vaccinated people with Covid-19, according to the King’s College London study in May. Other common symptoms in vaccinated people were: Scientists also found that people who were jabbed and tested positive had milder symptoms compared those were unvaccinated. Researchers analysed data from participants logging their symptoms, tests and vaccines on the UK ZOE Covid Symptom Study app. They examined 2,278 adults who tested positive after vaccination and compared them to both vaccinated adults who tested negative and unvaccinated adults who tested positive. They wrote in the study: ""Generally, we saw similar symptoms of Covid-19 being reported overall in the app by people who had and hadn’t been vaccinated. ""However, fewer symptoms were reported over a shorter period of time by those who had already had a jab, suggesting that they were falling less seriously ill and getting better more quickly."" They added: ""Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for Covid-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab.""

They urged anyone who might experience sneezing after getting a jab to get tested for Covid-19 to make sure they have not contracted the virus. The study also lifted the lid on the risk factors that put people more at risk of infection post-vaccination. Individuals who had health conditions that limited their independence – such as frailty - were more at risk of coronavirus after vaccination, and of getting sick. Adults living in areas of higher deprivation were consistently at more risk of infection despite vaccination even when adjusting for health behaviours. Coronavirus infection in vaccinated individuals was less likely in individuals with a healthy lifestyle, for example a healthy diet and normal body mass index (BMI).

            Why COVID cases are now falling in the UK – and what could happen next

University of East Anglia provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list After two months of soaring COVID-19 cases in the UK, numbers have again started to fall – and to the surprise of many, fall quite dramatically. New cases peaked at 54,674 on July 17 before falling to 23,511 on July 27. They rose slightly to 27,734 on July 28, but the seven-day average continued to fall. We should note that whether this decline will continue is as yet uncertain, as the effect of lifting most of England’s remaining restrictions on July 19 is yet to work its way into the statistics. We probably won’t know the impact of this until at least the last day of July. But why might cases appear to be falling again so soon after restrictions have been lifted? To answer that question, we need to know something about how diseases spread and become endemic. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, isn’t the only coronavirus that affects humans. Other common, seasonal coronaviruses also infect us, causing the common cold. With these coronaviruses, immunity following an infection is measured more in months than in years. Most of us can expect repeat infections with these other coronaviruses throughout our lives, typically every three to six years. Our experience with COVID-19 may end up being the same. Reinfections following an initial natural SARS-CoV-2 infection are now also being reported in the UK.  Even immunisation will probably not give lifelong protection against COVID-19, and vaccine effectiveness is expected to decline over a number of months. Recent news reports from Israel suggest that the protection offered by the Pfizer vaccine may already be waning in older age groups. But protection against severe disease will probably last longer than protection against infection. This lack of long-term protection against infection means that herd immunity is probably impossible and that the virus will become endemic and continue to circulate in human populations. If this happens and the disease then stabilises, such that case numbers are constant across the population, neither increasing nor decreasing, it will have reached what’s called an “endemic equilibrium”. So is this what we’re now witnessing? Possibly. One of the basic models of how infectious disease cases change over time is called an SIR model, which looks at how many people are susceptible to a disease, infectious with it or have recovered from it (and so are immune) at any one time.  With this model, cases increase rapidly at the start of an epidemic as lots of people are susceptible, become infected, and go on to infect other susceptible people. But as infections mount, over time fewer people are susceptible and more have recovered. The rate of growth therefore decelerates, the epidemic reaches its peak, and then case numbers decline to an endemic equilibrium point, where they remain roughly stable. The real world, though, is rather more complex than a SIR model. It behaves more like a SEIRS model, a variation of the basic SIR model that incorporates other factors into calculating how the disease spreads.  In a SEIRS model, the rise and fall of case numbers and the point of endemic equilibrium depend on a range of influences. These include measures such as “beta” (which is the average number of contacts a person has over a set amount of time, multiplied by the probability of the disease being transmitted when there’s contact between a susceptible and an infectious person) and “latency” (which is the lag between someone being infected and becoming infectious). Critically, the model also factors in the changing immunity of the population, either through births and deaths or, as we have already discussed, waning immunity.  As in the SIR model, the rate of epidemic growth slows to a peak before cases fall back to an endemic level. But in this SEIRS model, the infection approaches its stable endemic equilibrium in a series of epidemic waves, as the model’s extra data inputs make it much more sensitive and complicated (and as a result more realistic). For example, if beta increases because contact between people increases, then this will change the endemic equilibrium at which cases level off. More contact will see a surge in infections until they start to settle around a higher equilibrium. Similarly, if beta decreases we’ll see a drop in infections until the new equilibrium is approached. Beta’s coming home The changes we’ve seen over the past couple of months are likely due to changes in contact between people across the UK. We were in fact seeing the delta variant wave slowing quite quickly by mid-June, suggesting that we were approaching the endemic equilibrium. But then something happened that shifted beta significantly: the European Football Championship (which ran from June 11 to July 11). Cases started surging dramatically towards the end of June soon after England’s first game. That surge was quite short-lived and was already slowing again until another surge followed the quarterfinals before again slowing relatively quickly. In Scotland the pattern was different. We still saw a surge associated with the start of the Euros, but cases started falling about 10 days after their last game, which was on June 22. The difference in these graphs is therefore potentially explained by England reaching the final, sustaining higher levels of mixing for longer. And the patterns they show from early June onwards are consistent with the UK approaching the endemic equilibrium for COVID-19. This means we may not see another sustained surge in infections. July 19 will have influenced the beta measure somewhat, but even if we see some increase in cases as a result of things reopening, it’s unlikely to be great or sustained.

1," This article was published more than 1 year ago Something strange is happening in Britain. Covid cases are plummeting instead of soaring. LONDON — This is a puzzler. Coronavirus cases are plummeting in Britain. They were supposed to soar. Scientists aren't sure why they haven't. The daily number of new infections recorded in the country fell for seven days in a row before a slight uptick Wednesday, when the country reported 27,734 cases. That’s still almost half of where the caseload was a week ago. The trajectory of the virus in Britain is something the world is watching closely and anxiously, as a test of how the delta variant behaves in a society with relatively high vaccination rates. And now people are asking if this could be the first real-world evidence that the pandemic in Britain is sputtering out — after three national lockdowns and almost 130,000 deaths. Public health experts, alongside the government, predicted that cases would be rising in Britain at this point, perhaps even exponentially. The highly contagious delta variant of the virus, first detected in India, accounts for almost all new cases here. On July 17, the number of new day cases reached 54,674, the highest since January. Two days later, dubbed “Freedom Day” by the press, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government ended almost all government mandates in England for mask-wearing and social distancing. Pubs are serving pints at the rail and night clubs have reopened with maskless youths packed on the dance floors. Viral defense is now a “personal choice.” And so some of the best infectious-disease modelers on the planet warned that 100,000 new cases a day this summer could be expected. But the trend since then has been on a sharp decline. Scientists have theories. Maybe it’s the sunshine? There was a week-long heat wave. Schools have closed for the summer break, so children are not spreading the virus as much. Test-and-trace might be working. Last week, almost 620,000 people were pinged by a National Health Service app in England and Wales telling them to quarantine after exposure to the virus. It is also possible that people have stopped getting tested — because if they test positive, even if they are fully vaccinated, they are asked to quarantine for 10 days, even if they are about to travel abroad for their holidays. Or maybe Britain has reached an immunity threshold. More than 70 percent of adults here are fully vaccinated, and 88 percent have had a first dose — one of the best vaccine uptakes in the world. Among those who remain unvaccinated, many have had covid or asymptomatic infection. Britain could be approaching “population immunity, with people immune either from vaccinations or natural infection,” said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia. He noted that the reverb from Freedom Day wouldn’t be instantaneous. Any bump in cases would start to show up later this week or early next, as symptoms can appear up to two weeks after exposure. But he predicted, overall, “we won’t see the huge surges that we’ve seen in the past.” Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said he doubted that Britain was reaching population or herd immunity, in part because that wouldn’t explain regional differences. “I don’t have a simple answer, none of us do,” he said. Johnson is not celebrating. Not yet. Speaking to reporters on a rainy Tuesday from under an unusually smallish umbrella, the prime minister said that, yes, he has noticed the “better figures.” But he added: “It is very, very important that we don’t allow ourselves to run away with premature conclusions about this.” “People have got to remain very cautious, and that remains the approach of the government,” he said. Hospitalizations and deaths are still rising, though at a far slower rate than during previous waves. More than 6,000 covid patients are in hospitals in Britain, the highest figure since March. On Wednesday, Britain reported 91 new deaths. But the people so want the pandemic to end. The Daily Mail’s front page Wednesday declared: “Covid is all over bar the shouting.” On Wednesday, the government announced that fully vaccinated visitors from the United States and Europe could travel to England starting Aug. 2 without quarantining. (The reverse is not true, however. Even as England is reopening, the United States has kept restrictions for travelers from Britain and the European Union in place.) Stephen Griffin, an associate professor at the University of Leeds, said the reduction of cases was “very, very strange.” He cautioned that further data needs to be analyzed but suggested that it could be a result of a raft of behavioral factors, ranging from the warm weather to people following quarantine guidance to people avoiding tests if they want to go on vacation. Another factor is the end of the Euro 2020 soccer tournament, which drove thousands into pubs and onto the streets. “All of these things compounded together may genuinely reflect a reduced number of tested positive cases,” he said. “Whether that actually reflects infection or not, we don’t know.” Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London whose models have shaped government policy in Britain and the United States, said it now appears possible that the pandemic could be in the rearview mirror. He added his own notes of caution, too. He told the BBC on Tuesday that the effects of lifting restrictions on Freedom Day earlier this month have yet to be seen. Ferguson also said there could be a spike in cases if the weather turns bad or when schools return in September. “We’re not completely out of the woods,” he said. “But the equation has fundamentally changed. The effect of vaccines has been huge in reducing the risk of hospitalizations and death. And I’m positive that by late September or October . . . we will be looking back at most of the pandemic.” Ferguson added: “We will have covid with us. We will still have people dying from covid. But we’ll have put the bulk of the pandemic behind us.” 
 
 The latest: The CDC has loosened many of its recommendations for battling the coronavirus, a strategic shift that puts more of the onus on individuals, rather than on schools, businesses and other institutions, to limit viral spread. Variants: BA.5 is the most recent omicron subvariant, and it’s quickly become the dominant strain in the U.S. Here’s what to know about it, and why vaccines may only offer limited protection. Vaccines: For people under 50, second booster doses are on hold while the Biden administration works to roll out shots specifically targeting the omicron subvariants this fall. Immunizations for children under 5 became available this summer. Guidance: CDC guidelines have been confusing — if you get covid, here’s how to tell when you’re no longer contagious.

 Wednesday 28 July 2021 23:39, UK The number of new COVID-19 cases recorded in the UK has risen after seven consecutive days of falls, according to government data. The country has reported 27,734 new infections and 91 more coronavirus-related deaths in the latest 24-hour period. The figures compare with 23,511 cases and 131 deaths announced yesterday, while 44,104 cases and 73 deaths were recorded this time last week. However, despite the rise in cases, the seven-day average was 36.1% down from the previous week. Since the pandemic began, a total of 129,430 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive COVID test. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show there have been 154,000 deaths registered in the UK where COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Some 35,446 people had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine yesterday, taking the total to 46,689,242.

                 And 151,851 had their second jab, meaning 37,610,911 are now fully inoculated. It comes as Boris Johnson stressed the need for caution despite recent falls in the number of cases. The prime minister said recent data showing a drop in cases was ""encouraging"" but warned the virus ""still presents a significant risk"". He made the remarks after a senior minister told the Daily Mail that COVID is ""all over bar the shouting"". The PM's comments were echoed by Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who said it was ""encouraging"" to see case numbers falling but that it was ""too early to take a long-term trend from that"". ""There is still a lot of the virus around, unfortunately, so we have to remain cautious and vigilant,"" he said. ""The vaccines really are our weapon against this horrible virus - it's our wall of defence. And that wall is getting higher all the time."" However, Mike Tildesley, who sits on the scientific advisory body Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), said it was not yet clear whether the third wave was turning around. Dr Tildesley, professor of infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, said a recent fall in infections could be attributable to people being less willing to ""step up"" and get tested ahead of their summer holidays. Asked about the prospect of looking back on the pandemic in October, the prime minister told LBC Radio: ""We've seen some encouraging recent data, there's no question about that, but it is far, far too early to draw any general conclusions."" And asked whether it was certain that fully vaccinated people would be able to avoid having to self-isolate from next month if they come into contact with a positive coronavirus case, Mr Johnson said: ""August 16 is nailed on - there has never been any question of a review date for August 16. ""I'm very pleased that this is a country that now has the highest proportion of vaccinated adults of any country in the world - that is enabling us to make the economic progress we are.""

3," Covid: No quarantine for fully jabbed US and EU travellers By George Bowden & Francesca GillettBBC News This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Grant Shapps explains the new rules People who were fully vaccinated in the EU or US will not need to isolate when coming to England, Scotland and Wales from an amber list country. The change will come into force at 04:00 BST on Monday. Currently, only people who received their jabs in the UK can avoid quarantine when arriving from amber list countries, except France. The UK government said the rule change would help to reunite family and friends whose loved ones live abroad. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it would apply to people who have been fully vaccinated with a jab approved by the EU or US, with the final dose at least 14 whole days before arrival. Travellers will still need to take either a lateral flow or PCR test pre-departure and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive. Under-18s will be exempt from isolation, and some will not have to test, depending on their age. It come as a further 27,734 cases were reported in the UK, bringing to an end a seven-day run of falling case numbers. Wednesday's case figure was, however, down significantly from a week ago, when 44,104 cases were reported. Another 91 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported. Tougher rules will continue to be in place for France, which is on the amber list but still requires travellers to quarantine when they return, even if they are fully vaccinated. Mr Shapps said this advice would be reviewed at ""the end of next week"" as part of the rolling assessment of travel rules. As part of the changes, international cruise ships will be able to depart from England from 2 August - after a 16-month pause. At-a-glance: latest changes Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the change to the rules would provide ""a boost for the tourism sector and wider economy while ensuring public health is protected"". He added that the change would be ""carefully monitored by clinicians and kept under close review"". The Welsh government said the move posed ""clear public health risks"" - but its shared open border with England made it ""ineffective"" to have different arrangements.  Welsh health minister Eluned Morgan said vaccines would reduce the risks but only if they were effective against any new variants of concern and cautioned against international travel for non-essential reasons this summer. In Northern Ireland, people vaccinated in the UK and travelling from amber list countries have not needed to self-isolate since 19 July, subject to testing. The Stormont Executive is set to consider the policy of allowing those vaccinated in the US and EU to enter Northern Ireland without quarantine on Thursday. But what about children? Airlines UK, which represents big carriers, said the move would offer ""a lifeline for thousands of businesses reliant on international inbound travel"". Joss Croft, of trade association UKinbound, said it would ""allow the £28bn inbound tourism sector, which supports over 500,000 jobs across the UK, to finally restart"". Although US citizens will soon be able to avoid quarantine in England, Scotland and Wales, they are being urged not to travel to the UK by their country's health protection agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  And the US border is currently closed to the UK, as well as many other countries, except for US citizens. The UK and US have set up a taskforce to discuss a travel corridor, although earlier this week the White House said it had no plans to lift Covid-19 travel restrictions for non-Americans. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson told LBC on Wednesday that ""we're talking to them the whole time"". Family and friends reunited For 70-year-old Patricia Duncan in Spain, the changes will mean she can travel to England and be on hand to support her daughter ahead of an operation - without needing to isolate. ""I have another friend with mental health issues who is desperate for me to visit,"" she says. ""Normally I travel three or four times a year to see my family and friends, and it's been a long time. So I'm very glad that is happening."" But Fiona Clarke in Portugal says the cost of Covid testing is still a barrier for her to visit family in Brighton. ""I think we'll look very carefully, we'll wait and see what happens with the testing,"" she says. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said she had ""real concerns"" over the plan. ""Each individual US state does things differently,"" she said. ""They don't have a National Health Service that has a vaccine programme like we do with the certifications. ""So we're really concerned about making sure that new variants do not come into the UK and that we do have a system that identifies where we have variants of Covid where infection is and we're able to isolate it.""

4," Covid: North East 'not out of the woods' despite infection fall Health chiefs have warned the North East of England is ""not out of the woods"" despite the region's fall in coronavirus cases. According to Newcastle City Council, the average infection rate across the region is 566 per 100,000 people - down from 878 on Friday. However, its director of public health said the impact of easing restrictions on 19 July was not yet clear. The city previously had the highest infection rate in the country. Prof Eugene Milne told BBC Newcastle the ""upwards pressure"" in positive cases in the city ""began to diminish at the beginning of July"" with several factors likely to be involved. 'Everyone knows what happened' The numbers, he suggested, might have been affected by people testing themselves less often and by students having left the city for their summer breaks. He added: ""A note of caution is we may not have seen any impact in changes in behaviour that followed 19 July. ""We know the city was very busy last weekend. We're waiting with bated breath to see if there is an impact from increased mixing. ""We're nowhere near down to the levels we saw last summer and everybody knows what happened after that so I think we need to be awfully careful. We're not out of the woods."" 'Seasonal effect' His Gateshead counterpart, Alice Wiseman, urged people to continue social distancing and wearing face coverings, which she said were ""contributing to that reduction [in infection numbers] along with probably a seasonal effect"". ""Better weather means people are more likely to be meeting outdoors and schools, colleges and universities have finished. ""But more importantly there are fewer opportunities for the virus to infect people as natural immunity and vaccine immunity increases."" The health chiefs' comments come after a five-week government support package was launched in the region on Monday. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

 UK begins donating millions of Covid-19 vaccines overseas Foreign Secretary announces the UK will begin to deliver nine million Covid-19 vaccines around the world to help tackle the pandemic. Nine million vaccines to be donated bilaterally and offered to COVAX to help tackle Covid-19 abroad. The vaccines are expected to start leaving the UK this week, with Indonesia, Jamaica and Kenya among countries set to receive doses. The UK has pledged to donate 100 million vaccines overseas by June 2022, 80 million of which will go to COVAX. The UK will this week begin delivering nine million Covid-19 vaccines around the world, including to Indonesia, Jamaica and Kenya, to help tackle the pandemic, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced today (Wednesday 28 July). Five million doses are being offered to COVAX, the scheme to ensure equitable, global access to Covid-19 vaccines. COVAX will urgently distribute them to lower-income countries via an equitable allocation system which prioritises delivering vaccines to people who most need them. Another four million doses will be shared directly with countries in need. Indonesia will receive 600,000 doses, 300,000 will be sent to Jamaica and 817,000 are to be transported to Kenya, among other countries. The UK is donating the University of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, made by Oxford Biomedica in Oxford and packaged in Wrexham, North Wales. This is the first tranche of the 100 million vaccines the Prime Minister pledged the UK would share within the next year at last month’s G7 in Cornwall, with 30 million due to be sent by the end of the year. At least 80 million of the 100 million doses will go to COVAX, with the rest going to countries directly. The donations will help meet the pledge that G7 leaders made to vaccinate the world and end the pandemic in 2022. This week’s deployment will help meet the urgent need for vaccines from countries around the world, including in Africa, South East Asia and the Caribbean. These regions are experiencing high levels of Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: The UK is sending nine million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, the first batch of the 100 million doses we’ve pledged, to get the most vulnerable parts of the world vaccinated as a matter of urgency. We’re doing this to help the most vulnerable, but also because we know we won’t be safe until everyone is safe. The UK has been at the forefront of the global response to Covid-19, including through investing £90 million to support the development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Over half a billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been delivered at a non-profit price globally, with two-thirds going to lower- and middle-income countries. The UK also kick-started efforts to establish COVAX in 2020, providing a total of £548 million to fund vaccines for lower income countries. The scheme has delivered more than 152 million vaccine doses to over 137 countries and territories, including in 83 lower-middle income countries. 65% of the initial vaccine doses have been Oxford-AstraZeneca. COVAX aims to deliver 1.8 billion vaccines to lower-income countries around the world by early 2022. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: This is a global pandemic and Covid-19 vaccines are the best way to protect people and prevent the emergence of new variants. We want to make sure developing countries can build a wall of defence against the virus as we have in the UK through our vaccine rollout. The UK is one of the largest donors to COVAX and this donation is part of our pledge to send 100 million vaccines to some of the world’s poorest countries. The Government has secured enough doses for all UK residents, crown dependencies and overseas territories to support our ongoing vaccination programme and booster programme. Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which is co-leading COVAX alongside the World Health Organization and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said: The UK has been a steadfast supporter of COVAX since its inception and this announcement comes at an important time. Global vaccine demand is far outstripping supply, leaving millions of the most vulnerable unprotected, while higher vaccine coverage worldwide is one of our best shields against new variants. In this pandemic nobody is safe until everyone is safe. Sir Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President BioPharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca, said: Each day we’re making progress in our mission to change the course of this pandemic by providing broad and equitable access to AstraZeneca’s vaccine. We are proud that over 80% of countries across the world have received doses of our vaccine, with two thirds supplied to lower middle income and low income countries. The close collaboration between UK Government and our academic and industry partners is critical to ensure we deliver vaccines at speed and protect as many people as possible against this deadly virus. Media enquiries Email newsdesk@fcdo.gov.uk Telephone 020 7008 3100 Contact the FCDO Communication Team via email (monitored 24 hours a day) in the first instance, and we will respond as soon as possible. Notes to editors The 9 million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses being donated are not needed for the domestic rollout. The doses will be UK-branded. Five million vaccines are being offered to COVAX, the global scheme to get Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries, to be delivered to the most vulnerable countries. Further details will be announced in due course. The UK has also signed agreements with Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Cambodia, Guyana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Thailand and Vietnam to receive up to four million doses. The vaccines doses being donated on a bilateral basis are being transported by Crown Agents.
Details of future donations will be announced in due course. Around 80% of the total 100 million doses will go to COVAX, and the remainder will be shared bilaterally with countries in need. The UK provided £90 million to support the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine: £25m on the initial research & development, and £65m to scale up manufacturing. The UK made it clear as part of that funding that the vaccine should be affordable around the world and consequently AstraZeneca agreed to distribute it at a non-profit price during the pandemic. The cost of this donation has been funded through UK Overseas Development Assistance, and will come over and above the ODA spending target of 0.5% of GNI if needed.

6," Pingdemic: Bar staff being told to delete NHS Covid-19 app By Megan LawtonNewsbeat reporter More than 600,000 people using the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales were sent self-isolation alerts in the week between 8 and 15 July. And about one in five hospitality workers are isolating. It's caused staff shortages in lots of industries, including the hospitality sector which employs over three million people. With whole teams being ""pinged"" at once, pubs, restaurants and hotels have been forced to temporarily shut, pushing some hospitality staff to delete the app. 'I've lost so much money' Rachael tells Radio 1 Newsbeat isolating has cost her between £300 and £400 in missed shifts. The 22-year-old who lives in Brighton and, until two weeks ago, worked in a bar explains: ""I've been pinged twice while on my way to shifts. ""Both times I've tested negative on lateral flows and PCRs. I don't agree with not self-isolating, but the app gives you no context on who you've been near."" Although isolating after being pinged isn't a legal requirement, the government urges people to do so. In a recent interview, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC: ""If you are pinged, you should self-isolate. I know it poses challenges but the rules are clear and I think they should be followed."" Rachael says a big factor in deleting the app was a lack of sick pay. ""If I'm off, I get no income or support. If I did I would self-isolate."" Frustrated by a lack of earnings, she spoke to her manager about ending one of her isolations early. ""I asked my boss, 'If I got a test today, and it's negative, can I work?' ""He said no because the head office was being strict, but in our staff WhatsApp chat he later messaged to say people should delete the app because they're losing so many staff."" Rachael agrees with her boss and wanted to delete the app. 'I'm not willing to put people at risk' Ralph (not his real name) can relate to this pressure. He's 27, works in a bar in London and has been told to delete the app, although he's decided to go against his manager. ""Having the app is the right thing to do and whether or not I've got a manager telling me to have it, I'm going to keep it,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Ralph has also been told to ignore being pinged, even after doing a shift with a colleague who tested positive. ""The app said I needed to isolate for 8 days, so I told my manager straightaway. He said to come in, take one lateral flow test and if that's negative to continue working."" Ralph describes the situation as ""worrying"", and although he understands why his manager needs him in, decided to ""put his foot down."" ""The worst case scenario is I'm positive, I go into work and spread it to staff and customers and that effectively puts people's lives at risk and that's something I'm not comfortable doing."" Like Rachael, Ralph isn't paid if he doesn't go to work. On the whole he says he feels safe when he's there, but questions some of the bar's policies. ""My manager asks us all to wear 'exempt' badges because he doesn't want us wearing masks. I understand he wants to create a relaxed atmosphere for customers, but we're still in a pandemic."" 'Ethically and morally it doesn't feel right' For Lucy, a 24-year-old bar supervisor in London, her workplace does feel safe. They follow social distancing rules, and all customers check into the venue. However like Ralph, she's been told to delete her app. She says ""keeping it wasn't an option"". ""There wasn't a conversation about it, which from a safety point, I don't really agree with. I felt like my safety was compromised."" Two weeks ago Lucy and three other members of staff contracted Covid. Their manager asked them not to enter the positive tests into the NHS app as he worried it could shut the bar down. ""I felt a bit awkward. It's not about me and my workplace, it's also about the places I've been outside of work. ""I could be putting other people at risk. Ethically and morally it didn't sit with me very well."" What should you do? So if like Lucy and Ralph you want to keep the app, what are your rights in the workplace? Beth Hale is a lawyer who specialises in employment. She tells Radio 1 Newsbeat, it all comes down to judgement. She explains: ""An employee is obliged to follow reasonable instructions. ""A blanket instruction that all staff should delete the app is unlikely to be reasonable."" If you are told to delete the app against your will, Beth suggests ""having a rational conversation"". ""Part of the problem is the confusion there is between the NHS Test and Trace system and the NHS app. With the app, there is no legal obligation to have it and it does not create a legal obligation to self-isolate. Being contacted by NHS test and trace however does create a legal obligation."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

7," Downing Street Covid briefings excluded deaf BSL users, judge finds Deaf woman successfully argues equality law was breached after government failed to provide interpreters Downing Street’s failure to provide British Sign Language interpreters during live Covid briefings was discriminatory and breached equality legislation, a high court judge has ruled. Kate Rowley, from Leeds, who is profoundly deaf, successfully argued that the government was breaching its obligations to make its broadcasts accessible to deaf people under the Equality Act. The case related to two “data briefings” on the 21 September and 12 October last year, led by medical and scientific advisers rather than a government minister. No BSL interpreter was provided on any channel for either briefing. Similar briefings by the Welsh first ministe,r Mark Drakeford, his Scottish counterpart, Nicola Sturgeon, and from Stormont in Northern Ireland included British Sign Language interpreters on screen. In his written judgment on Wednesday, Mr Justice Fordham said: “Without BSL interpretation there was a clear barrier, for a vulnerable and marginalised group, undermining accessibility of information. The message was blocked, or scrambled, or delayed. The barrier to information in an accessible format arose by reason of disability. The lack of provision – the provision of subtitles only – was a failure of inclusion, suggestive of not being thought about, which served to disempower, to frustrate and to marginalise. “The immediate experience was of important urgent messaging being delivered to the public … but with an inability to access or understand it.” The court heard that Rowley, who is in her 30s and was living alone at the time of the briefings in question, was also pregnant and anxious after a series of miscarriages. She was “outraged that there had been no BSL interpreter for the data briefings; she said she felt that the government did not care about her, her unborn baby or deaf people who use BSL”. Fordham found that the minster for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, was in breach of section 29(7)a, which imposes on a “service-provider” a statutory “duty to make reasonable adjustments”. The judge sent the case to the county court for assessment of damages payable to Rowley, a self-employed actor and writer, who is also visually impaired and dyslexic. However, Fordham rejected Rowley’s argument that the government was in “continuing breach” of the reasonable adjustments duty by offering only “in-screen” interpreters as opposed to an on-platform BSL interpreter during briefings, as happens in Scotland and Wales, saying this was a policy choice ministers were entitled to make. The British Deaf Association has estimated that there are 151,000 BSL users across the UK, of whom 87,000 are deaf BSL users, and Fordham said the lack of provision during the two briefings in question would have affected “a significant and substantial number of people”.

9," Sajid Javid admits UK Covid rates unpredictable as cases rise again Health secretary’s comments came after a week of declining cases ended with 4,000 increase in one day Sajid Javid has said “no one really knows” what trajectory the Covid pandemic will take in the weeks ahead, as new cases across the UK rose after seven days of consecutive declines. The latest Covid data, published on Wednesday, showed 27,734 people testing positive across the UK – up by 4,000 from a day earlier. The increase in cases followed a week of sharp declines that had brought the number of new positive test results down by more than half from 54,674 on 17 July, just before most restrictions were relaxed. Speaking at a vaccination centre in Little Venice, west London, the health secretary conceded, “the truth is, when it comes to case numbers no one really knows where they are going to go next. “I hope that the falls that we’re seeing now are sustained. That’s of course what I want to see. But we’ve already seen with the Delta variant, a new variant that emerged over the last year, that’s more infectious than the previous one, that things can change. “And so, I think it’s important to remain cautious, not get too optimistic.” It is unclear whether the impact of the 19 July relaxation, when most restrictions were scrapped, has yet shown up in the data. Earlier in the day, the prime minister had confirmed the 16 August date when quarantine will be scrapped for double-jabbed adults in England is now “nailed on”. Ministers had last week declined to confirm the 16 August date. The environment secretary, George Eustice, said it was just “some kind of indication” and could move in either direction. When the prime minister was asked on LBC on Wednesday if the date could change, however, he said there had never been any doubt about it. “16 August is nailed on. There’s never been any question of a review date,” he said. He was asked about comments made by Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, where he said refusing to be vaccinated was a “selfish act”. Johnson said: “I would put it the other way round. If you get one, you’re doing something massively positive, for yourself, for your family.” There were 91 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result reported across the UK on Wednesday, down from 131 a day earlier. Deaths follow positive cases with a significant time lag. When the more relaxed quarantine regime comes in on 16 August, double-jabbed adults identified as close contacts of a person who has tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate. Instead they will be advised to take a PCR test. If it returns a positive result, they will be legally obliged to quarantine; if it is negative, they can go about their lives as normal. Children will also be exempted from having to quarantine and advised to take a PCR test, despite the fact they are not being given the vaccine. Ministers hope the move will help to reduce the significant disruption faced in the education sector in recent weeks, in which more than a million children were off school at the end of term. The government also believe that releasing the double-vaccinated from the obligation to quarantine will help to create another incentive for those reluctant to get the jab to come forward. The leaders of UK universities have pledged to step up efforts to see their students vaccinated “as soon as possible” by the early stages of the academic year starting in autumn. In a joint statement the vice-chancellors and principals said they “want to get back to a more normal life and higher education experience,” and committed to working with public health officials to offer facilities such as pop-up vaccination sites on campus over the summer and start of term. The effort was backed by the University and College Union. Jo Grady, UCU’s general secretary, said: “We would now welcome further commitments around health and safety.” The shift to the more relaxed self-isolation rules was the one element of step four of the government’s unlocking “roadmap” that did not go ahead on 19 July, after ministers were told that self-isolation was important in constraining cases. Explaining that decision to MPs earlier this month, Johnson said, “I’m afraid this is a highly contagious disease and we have to do what we can to stop this spread.” Most popular Most popular","Wed, 28 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/28/end-to-quarantine-in-england-for-double-jabbed-is-nailed-on-for-16-august,Sajid Javid admits UK Covid rates unpredictable as cases rise again - The Guardian
10," Covid vaccine: Thorpe Park in Surrey opens pop-up clinic A vaccine clinic is opening at a theme park to encourage more younger adults to get vaccinated against Covid-19. Visitors to Thorpe Park in Surrey will be able to get vaccinated before getting on a rollercoaster. Health Secretary Sajid Javid described it as a ""fantastic opportunity for young people and families to get a vaccine while they enjoy a day out"". A Primark store in Bristol and The Open Golf tournament in Kent were among other venues used in the vaccine push. The Thorpe Park pop-up clinic will be offering Pfizer jabs to anyone who has not yet taken up the offer, or second doses to those who are eligible, the NHS said. Figures up to 18 July suggest that 66.4% of people aged 18 to 29 in England have had their first jab. Dr Nikki Kanani, from the NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme, said: ""We know that people, and particularly young people, are leading busier lives, so whether you are queuing for the Colossus or staffing the ice cream kiosk, we are making getting a jab as easy as possible."" Mr Javid said:  ""Already three in five adults aged 18-24 have received a first jab, which is excellent progress.  ""I urge all those yet to get their first or second dose to take advantage of the hundreds of pop-ups around the country and help us cautiously get back to normality.""

University of Stirling provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list The world is 19 months into COVID-19 and more than 4m people have died. Many countries have rising death rates and desperately require COVID-19 vaccination supplies. Others, including the UK, are benefiting from high vaccination uptake and decreasing deaths.  But fewer deaths do not equate to fewer cases. While in England collective measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 have been jettisoned, the number of infections across the UK as a whole is still rising. It is now clear that increases in COVID-19 cases will result in growing numbers of people experiencing symptoms of varying degrees following their initial infection. A recent study found that 38% of people with COVID-19 had at least one enduring symptom 12 weeks later – a condition known as long COVID. Long COVID presents in many different ways. In a recent survey of COVID support groups, people who had either confirmed or suspected COVID-19 said that after six months their most common symptoms included fatigue, worsening of symptoms after very little activity and difficulty in thinking clearly – also known as “brain fog”. Responses to long COVID Long COVID affects people’s ability to go about their daily lives. In another recent UK survey respondents stated that it affected their family life (71%), ability to work (80%), ability to look after their families (39%) and their finances (36%).  Almost half of respondents were working reduced hours, with 22% being unable to work at all. As a result, people living with long COVID are increasingly calling on governments to provide appropriate assessment, rehabilitation and economic assistance to support their recovery. To date, the four UK governments have responded differently to this condition. In December 2020 the Westminster government, responsible for health in England, launched a network of specialist multidisciplinary long COVID assessment centres. In June 2021 it extended these to include specific centres for children and young people.  In the same month, the Northern Ireland government announced the establishment of similar centres, while the Welsh government announced a £5m recovery plan, including a self-care app and a new referral pathway to help GPs guide patients with long COVID through existing services. In August 2020 the Scottish government published a high-level COVID-19 recovery and rehabilitation framework. But so far it has not provided any financial support for the development of specific centres – as England and Northern Ireland have – or strengthened existing care services and pathways – as Wales has done. Instead, recognising that little is known about how to best assess, treat and rehabilitate people with long COVID, the Scottish government has funded nine research projects totalling around £2.5m. More recently, a further £19.6m of National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) funding has also been awarded to universities across the UK to help diagnose and treat long COVID. Responding to a question following a recent briefing, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon stated that people with long COVID should attend their GP, who will refer them to relevant services. Our own research conducted earlier this year found that every territorial NHS health board in Scotland was providing rehabilitation services, in different ways, for these long COVID patients. But while some Scottish COVID-19 treatment pathways and dedicated services have been developed, they are not universally available nor supported with additional funding. As a result, many health professionals and people with long COVID appear unaware of what services are available. Anecdotal evidence suggests that referrals for long COVID rehabilitation in several Scottish health boards are lower than anticipated. What can be done? UK-wide guidelines on managing the long-term effects of COVID-19 recommend that multidisciplinary rehabilitation teams should support people’s recovery. But rehabilitation services have often been perceived as neglected and sometimes disjointed. Long COVID has highlighted some of the limitations of these pre-existing systems. The latest Scottish government figures estimate that between 46,000 (0.7% of the population) and 110,000 (1.9%) people were estimated to experience long COVID in Scotland. Even if only a small proportion of these people were referred to existing rehabilitation services as currently funded, these services would quickly become overwhelmed. Additional funding is required to support the foreseeable surge in demand and the training required to upskill staff.  The jury is out as to whether specialist clinics or integration within existing services will prove to be most effective for people requiring long COVID rehabilitation. But, as has been argued elsewhere: “In the face of a pandemic the search for perfect evidence may be the enemy of good policy.” In other words, in situations such as this, it is best not to wait for the highest levels of evidence about “what works” before intervening – especially in cases such as long COVID where some forms of rehabilitation already exist for people who present with similar symptoms. This approach is known as the “precautionary principle”. In these circumstances, research – which remains essential – and practice best proceed hand in hand. It is time for Scotland to embrace the precautionary principle in long COVID rehabilitation and act – even without definitive evidence of what is best. Investment to scale up and publicise existing specialist and integrated long COVID rehabilitation would enable people to receive much-needed help and support. Researchers like us – working in close collaboration with health and social care services and people living with long COVID – are well placed to evaluate these different forms of rehabilitation as they are made available, and we can develop and recommend how best to implement these services as they emerge.

12," Myanmar could become Covid ‘super-spreader’ state, says UN expert Special rapporteur urges security council to call for ceasefire amid fears Covid will spread across wider region Myanmar is at risk of becoming a super-spreader Covid state that fuels outbreaks across the region, the UN special rapporteur for the country has warned as he urged the security council to call for a ceasefire. The south-east Asian country is facing its most severe outbreak yet, on top of a deep political and economic crisis brought about by the military coup in February. Its vaccination programme has ground to a standstill, testing has collapsed, and government hospitals are barely functioning. Doctors, who have been at the forefront of an anti-junta strike and are refusing to work in state hospitals, have been forced to treat patients in secret because they face the constant threat of military violence or arrest. The exact number of cases and fatalities in Myanmar was unclear, said Tom Andrews, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, in an interview with the Guardian. The targeting of journalists and doctors has made it hard to obtain accurate information about the crisis.  “We know that this is a spike upward. It’s a very rapid, an alarmingly rapid rise,” said Andrews. According to the military-controlled ministry of health and sports, 4,629 people have died of Covid since 1 June. The figures are thought to be an underestimate. Military-controlled media announced on Tuesday that 10 new crematoriums would be built at cemeteries in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, to cope with the fatalities, the Irrawaddy news site, an independent outlet, reported. “In Yangon, it’s common to see three types of lines,” Andrews added. “One before ATMs, one for oxygen supplies – which is very dangerous because people are literally being shot at by the Myanmar forces for standing in line for oxygen – and the third being lines at crematoriums and morgues.” There is a severe shortage of oxygen, medical equipment and medication in cities across the country. Outside homes, people have hung yellow and white flags to signal that they need food or medicine, while social media have been flooded with pleas for help and death notices. The military has been accused of seizing oxygen supplies. It has ordered suppliers not to sell to the public, claiming that people are hoarding tanks. Andrews said international governments, including Myanmar’s neighbours, needed to act swiftly, or they would see the consequences of an uncontrolled outbreak at their borders. “Myanmar is becoming a super-spreader of Covid-19 with these very virulent variants – Delta and other forms of the disease, [which are] extremely dangerous, extremely lethal, extremely contagious … This is very, very dangerous for all kinds of reasons,” Andrews said. “It’s just a fact that Covid does not respect nationalities or borders or ideologies or political parties. It’s an equal opportunities killer. This is a region that is susceptible to even greater suffering as a result of Myanmar becoming a super-spreader state.” About a third of the world’s population lives in countries neighbouring Myanmar, he added. This includes China, which, along with Russia, has blocked previous attempts by the security council to pressure the Myanmar military. In February, the security council passed a resolution demanding ceasefires in all states experiencing conflict so that health workers could safely provide Covid vaccinations. Andrews said the resolution should now be reaffirmed in relation to the Myanmar crisis. This could help pave the way for international agencies to provide greater assistance. On Wednesday, the military-controlled Global New Light of Myanmar reported that junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing, had addressed a meeting “to beef up cooperation with the international community, including Asean [Association of South-east Asian Nations] and friendly countries in the prevention, control and treatment of the Covid-19”. The details of the cooperation are not clear. Junta forces have engaged in at least 260 attacks against medical personnel and facilities, killing at least 18 people, according to the Office of the United Nations high commissioner for human rights. The military is holding at least 67 healthcare workers, and has issued arrest warrants for a further 600 medics. Last week, military officials reportedly posed as Covid patients in need of treatment to entrap medical volunteers in Yangon. Three doctors who went to help were subsequently arrested, according to a report by the independent outlet Myanmar Now.In total, at least 5,630 people are being held in detention facilities, including Insein prison in Yangon, where the virus has spread. U Nyan Win, who previously served as Aung San Suu Kyi’s lawyer, and who was a senior member in her National League for Democracy party, died of Covid after becoming infected in jail, it was confirmed last week. At least 931 people – protesters, politicians and bystanders – have been killed by the military since February. There is significant evidence that crimes against humanity are unfolding in Myanmar, Andrews said. “This is not an errant commander here or there doing horrible things, this is very systematic, very clear … The junta going on state television and telling people don’t go on the streets [to protest] or you’ll get shot in the head. And then suddenly all these people are shot in the head.” Andrews said the need for international action was more urgent than ever. “The people of Myanmar are losing hope that the international community cares about what is happening in Myanmar,” he said.

A computer simulation of the structure of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.Credit: Janet Iwasa, University of Utah The coronavirus sports a luxurious sugar coat. “It’s striking,” thought Rommie Amaro, staring at her computer simulation of one of the trademark spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which stick out from the virus’s surface. It was swathed in sugar molecules, known as glycans. “When you see it with all the glycans, it’s almost unrecognizable,” says Amaro, a computational biophysical chemist at the University of California, San Diego. Many viruses have glycans covering their outer proteins, camouflaging them from the human immune system like a wolf in sheep’s clothing. But last year, Amaro’s laboratory group and collaborators created the most detailed visualization yet of this coat, based on structural and genetic data and rendered atom-by-atom by a supercomputer. On 22 March 2020, she posted the simulation to Twitter. Within an hour, one researcher asked in a comment: what was the naked, uncoated loop sticking out of the top of the protein? Amaro had no idea. But ten minutes later, structural biologist Jason McLellan at the University of Texas at Austin chimed in: the uncoated loop was a receptor binding domain (RBD), one of three sections of the spike that bind to receptors on human cells (see ‘A hidden spike’). Source: Structural image from Lorenzo Casalino, Univ. California, San Diego (Ref. 1); Graphic: Nik Spencer/Nature In Amaro’s simulation, when the RBD lifted up above the glycan cloud, two glycans swooped in to lock it into place, like a kickstand on a bicycle. When Amaro mutated the glycans in the computer model, the RBD collapsed. McLellan’s team built a way to try the same experiment in the lab, and by June 2020, the collaborators had reported that mutating the two glycans reduced the ability of the spike protein to bind to a human cell receptor1 — a role that no one has previously recognized in coronaviruses, McLellan says. It’s possible that snipping out those two sugars could reduce the virus’s infectivity, says Amaro, although researchers don’t yet have a way to do this. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists have been developing a detailed understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infects cells. By picking apart the infection process, they hope to find better ways to interrupt it through improved treatments and vaccines, and learn why the latest strains, such as the Delta variant, are more transmissible. What has emerged from 19 months of work, backed by decades of coronavirus research, is a blow-by-blow account of how SARS-CoV-2 invades human cells (see ‘Life cycle of the pandemic coronavirus’). Scientists have discovered key adaptations that help the virus to grab on to human cells with surprising strength and then hide itself once inside. Later, as it leaves cells, SARS-CoV-2 executes a crucial processing step to prepare its particles for infecting even more human cells. These are some of the tools that have enabled the virus to spread so quickly and claim millions of lives. “That’s why it’s so difficult to control,” says Wendy Barclay, a virologist at Imperial College London. Source: Hui (Ann) Liu, Univ. Utah; Graphic: Nik Spencer/Nature  Barbed and ready It starts with the spikes. Each SARS-CoV-2 virion (virus particle) has an outer surface peppered with 24–40 haphazardly arranged spike proteins that are its key to fusing with human cells2. For other types of virus, such as influenza, external fusion proteins are relatively rigid. SARS-CoV-2 spikes, however, are wildly flexible and hinge at three points, according to work published in August 2020 by biochemist Martin Beck at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics in Frankfurt, Germany, and his colleagues3. That allows the spikes to flop around, sway and rotate, which could make it easier for them to scan the cell surface and for multiple spikes to bind to a human cell. There are no similar experimental data for other coronaviruses, but because spike-protein sequences are highly evolutionarily conserved, it is fair to assume the trait is shared, says Beck. Cryo-electron tomography images of SARS-CoV-2 virions. (Scale bar: 30 nanometres.)Credit: B. Turoňová et al./Science Early in the pandemic, researchers confirmed that the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins attach to a familiar protein called the ACE2 receptor, which adorns the outside of most human throat and lung cells. This receptor is also the docking point for SARS-CoV, the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). But compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 an estimated 2–4 times more strongly4, because several changes in the RBD stabilize its virus-binding hotspots5. Worrying variants of SARS-CoV-2 tend to have mutations in the S1 subunit of the spike protein, which hosts the RBDs and is responsible for binding to the ACE2 receptor. (A second spike subunit, S2, prompts viral fusion with the host cell’s membrane.) The Alpha variant, for example, includes ten changes in the spike-protein sequence, which result in RBDs being more likely to stay in the ‘up’ position6. “It is helping the virus along by making it easier to enter into cells,” says Priyamvada Acharya, a structural biologist at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute in Durham, North Carolina, who is studying the spike mutations. The Delta variant, which is now spreading around the world, hosts multiple mutations in the S1 subunit, including three in the RBD that seem to improve the RBD’s ability to bind to ACE2 and evade the immune system7. Restricted entry Once the viral spikes bind to ACE2, other proteins on the host cell’s surface initiate a process that leads to the merging of viral and cell membranes (see ‘Viral entry up close’). Source: Janet Iwasa, Univ. Utah; Graphic: Nik Spencer/Nature  The virus that causes SARS, SARS-CoV, uses either of two host protease enzymes to break in: TMPRSS2 (pronounced ‘tempress two’) or cathepsin L. TMPRSS2 is the faster route in, but SARS-CoV often enters instead through an endosome — a lipid-surrounded bubble — which relies on cathepsin L. When virions enter cells by this route, however, antiviral proteins can trap them. SARS-CoV-2 differs from SARS-CoV because it efficiently uses TMPRSS2, an enzyme found in high amounts on the outside of respiratory cells. First, TMPRSS2 cuts a site on the spike’s S2 subunit8. That cut exposes a run of hydrophobic amino acids that rapidly buries itself in the closest membrane — that of the host cell. Next, the extended spike folds back onto itself, like a zipper, forcing the viral and cell membranes to fuse. An animation of the way SARS-CoV-2 fuses with cells.Credit: Janet Iwasa, University of Utah The virus then ejects its genome directly into the cell. By invading in this spring-loaded manner, SARS-CoV-2 infects faster than SARS-CoV and avoids being trapped in endosomes, according to work published in April by Barclay and her colleagues at Imperial College London9. The virus’s speedy entry using TMPRSS2 explains why the malaria drug chloroquine didn’t work in clinical trials as a COVID-19 treatment, despite early promising studies in the lab10. Those turned out to have used cells that rely exclusively on cathepsins for endosomal entry. “When the virus transmits and replicates in the human airway, it doesn’t use endosomes, so chloroquine, which is an endosomal disrupting drug, is not effective in real life,” says Barclay. The discovery also points to protease inhibitors as a promising therapeutic option to prevent a virus from using TMPRSS2, cathepsin L or other proteases to enter host cells. One TMPRSS2 inhibitor, camostat mesylate, which is approved in Japan to treat pancreatitis, blocked viral entry into lung cells8, but the drug did not improve patients’ outcomes in an initial clinical trial11. “From my perspective, we should have such protease inhibitors as broad antivirals available to fight new disease outbreaks and prevent future pandemics at the very beginning,” says Stefan Pöhlmann, director of the Infection Biology Unit at the German Primate Center in Göttingen, who has led research on ACE2 binding and the TMPRSS2 pathway. Deadly competition The next steps of infection are murkier. “There are a lot more black boxes once you are inside the cell,” says chemist Janet Iwasa at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, who is developing an annotated animation of the viral life cycle. “There’s more uncertainty, and competing hypotheses.” After the virus shoots its RNA genome into the cell, ribosomes in the cytoplasm translate two sections of viral RNA into long strings of amino acids, which are then snipped into 16 proteins, including many involved in RNA synthesis. Later, more RNAs are generated that code for a total of 26 known viral proteins, including structural ones used to make new virus particles, such as the spike, and other accessory proteins. In this way, the virus begins churning out copies of its own messenger RNA. But it needs the cell’s machinery to translate those mRNAs into proteins. 
 How a rampant coronavirus variant blunts our immune defences Coronaviruses take over that machinery in many ways. Virologist Noam Stern-Ginossar and her team at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, zoomed in on three mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 suppresses the translation of host mRNA in favour of its own. None are exclusive to this virus, but the combination, speed and magnitude of the effects seem unique, says Stern-Ginossar. First, the virus eliminates the competition: viral protein Nsp1, one of the first proteins translated when the virus arrives, recruits host proteins to systematically chop up all cellular mRNAs that don’t have a viral tag. When Stern-Ginossar’s team put that same tag on the end of a host mRNA, the mRNA was not chopped up12. Second, infection reduces overall protein translation in the cell by 70%. Nsp1 is again the main culprit, this time physically blocking the entry channel of ribosomes so mRNA can’t get inside, according to work from two research teams13,14. The little translation capacity that remains is dedicated to viral RNAs, says Stern-Ginossar. Finally, the virus shuts down the cell’s alarm system. This happens in numerous ways, but Stern-Ginossar’s team identified one clear mechanism for SARS-CoV-2: the virus prevents cellular mRNA from getting out of the nucleus, including instructions for proteins meant to alert the immune system to infection. A second team confirmed this finding, and again pointed to Nsp1: the protein seems to jam up exit channels in the nucleus so nothing can escape15. Because gene transcripts can’t get out of the nucleus, the infected cells don’t release many interferons — these are signalling proteins that alert the immune system to the presence of a virus. SARS-Cov-2 is particularly efficient at shutting down this alarm system: compared with other respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV and respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces significantly lower levels of interferons16. And this June, researchers reported mutations in the Alpha variant that seem to enable it to subdue interferon production even more efficiently17. “It’s clear that SARS-CoV-2 is a very fast virus that has a unique ability to prevent our immune system from recognizing and combating infection in the first stages,” says Stern-Ginossar. By the time the immune system does realize there is a virus, there is so much of it that immune-response proteins sometimes flood the bloodstream at a faster rate than normal — which can cause damage. Doctors saw early in the pandemic that some people with COVID-19 who become very ill are harmed by an overactive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, as well as by the virus itself. Some proven treatments work by dampening down this immune response. Renovation station Once the virus has taken over host translation, it starts a home makeover, extensively remodelling the interior and exterior of the cell to its needs. First, some of the newly made viral spike proteins travel to the surface of the cell and poke out of the host-cell membrane. There, they activate a host calcium-ion channel, which expels a fatty coating onto the outside of the cell — the same coating found on cells that naturally fuse together, such as muscle cells. At this point, the infected cell fuses to neighbouring cells expressing ACE2, developing into massive individual respiratory cells filled with up to 20 nuclei.

Nuclei are in blue and the cell skeleton is in red.Credit: Mauro Giacca These fused structures, called syncytia, are induced by viral infections such as HIV and herpes simplex virus, but not by the SARS virus, says molecular biologist Mauro Giacca at King’s College London, who led the team that published the finding in April18. He hypothesizes that forming syncytia allows infected cells to thrive for long periods of time, churning out more and more virions. “This is not a hit-and-run virus,” he says. “It persists.” A second team, led by researcher Qiang Sun at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Beijing, found that some COVID-19-infected cells even form syncytia with lymphocytes — one of the body’s own immune cells19. This is a known mechanism of immune evasion by tumour cells, but not by viruses. It suggests that infected cells avoid immune detection by simply grabbing on to and merging with nearby immune scouts. On the inside of the cell, even more change is occurring. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 transforms the long, thin endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a network of flat membranes involved in protein synthesis and transport, into double-membrane spheres, as if the ER were blowing bubbles. These double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) might provide a safe place for viral RNA to be replicated and translated, shielding it from innate immune sensors in the cell, but that hypothesis is still being investigated. Proteins involved in making DMVs could be good drug targets, because they seem to be necessary for viral replication. For instance, a host protein, TMEM41B, is needed to mobilize cholesterol and other lipids to expand the ER membranes so that all the virus parts will fit inside20. “When you take TMEM41B out, it has a major impact on infection,” says Vineet Menachery, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, who was involved in the research. The coronavirus transmembrane protein Nsp3 could also be a target: it creates a crown-like pore in the walls of the DMVs to shuttle out newly made viral RNA21. Most viruses that have an outer wrapping, known as an envelope, form this feature by assembly directly at the edge of the cell, co-opting some of the cell’s own plasma membrane on their way out. But newly made coronavirus proteins take a different path. For years, evidence has suggested that coronaviruses are transported out of the cell through the Golgi complex, an organelle that works like a post office, packaging molecules in membranes and sending them off to other parts of the cell. There, the virus forms a lipid envelope from the Golgi complex’s membrane; newly formed virions are then carried inside Golgi vesicles to the cell surface, where they are spat out of the cell, says virologist and cell biologist Carolyn Machamer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who has studied coronaviruses for 30 years. But in December, cell biologist Nihal Altan-Bonnet at the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, and her colleagues reported that they had detected coronaviruses leaving the cell through lysosomes — cellular rubbish bins full of enzymes that break down cell parts22. Blocking the Golgi-based secretory pathway didn’t seem to affect the amount of infectious virus being released, says Altan-Bonnet. Her team’s evidence22 suggests that viral proteins form an envelope by budding into the ER, then take over lysosomes to get out of the cell. The researchers are currently testing inhibitors that block the lysosomal exit process as potential antiviral candidates. Leaving a cell through either the Golgi or lysosomes is slow and inefficient compared with budding out of a plasma membrane, so scientists don’t know why SARS-CoV-2 does it. Machamer suspects that the lipid composition of a Golgi- or lysosome-derived envelope is somehow more beneficial to the virus than one from the plasma membrane. “If we understood this part a little bit better, there would be great opportunities for novel antiviral therapeutics,” she says. Last slice On the way out of the cell, one more event makes this virus into an infectious juggernaut: a quick snip at a site of five amino acids prepares the virus to strike its next target. Where other coronaviruses have a single arginine amino acid at the junction of the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike, SARS-CoV-2 has a line of five amino acids: proline, arginine, arginine, alanine and arginine. “Because the site was unusual, we focused on it, and it turned out that, yes, the site is essential for invasion of lung cells,” says Pöhlmann. In May 2020, he and his colleagues reported that a host-cell protein called furin recognizes and clips that string of amino acids — and the cut is “essential” for the virus to enter human lung cells efficiently23. It’s not the first time that researchers have identified a furin cleavage site on a virus; highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses also have it, says Barclay. When a colleague sent Barclay a strain of SARS-CoV-2 in culture that had spontaneously lost the furin cleavage site, her team found that ferrets infected with this strain shed viral particles in lower amounts than did those infected with the pandemic strain, and did not transmit the infection to nearby animals9. At the same time as Barclay’s team reported its results in a September 2020 preprint, a study in the Netherlands also found that coronavirus with an intact furin cleavage site enters human airway cells faster than do those without it24. Furin is suspected to cut the site at some point during virion assembly, or just before release. The timing might explain why the virus exits through the Golgi or lysosomes, says Tom Gallagher, a virologist at Loyola University Chicago in Illinois. “The virus, once assembled, moves into an organelle where it can be bathed in the presence of the furin protease.” By snipping the bond between the S1 and S2 subunits, the furin cut loosens up virion spike proteins so that during cell entry they respond to a second cut by TMPRSS2, which exposes the hydrophobic area that rapidly buries itself in a host-cell membrane, says Gallagher. If spikes are not pre-clipped by furin —and they aren’t always — they bypass TMPRSS2, and enter through the slower endosomal pathway, if at all. 
 The race for antiviral drugs to beat COVID — and the next pandemic Two coronavirus variants, Alpha and Delta, have altered furin cleavage sites. In the Alpha variant, the initial proline amino acid is changed to a histidine (P681H) ; in the Delta variant, it is changed to an arginine (P681R). Both changes make the sequence less acidic, and the more basic the string of amino acids, the more effectively furin recognizes and cuts it, says Barclay. “We would hypothesize that this is the virus getting even better at transmitting.” More furin cuts mean more spike proteins primed to enter human cells. In SARS-CoV, less than 10% of spike proteins are primed, says Menachery, whose lab group has been quantifying the primed spike proteins but is yet to publish this work. In SARS-CoV-2, that percentage rises to 50%. In the Alpha variant, it’s more than 50%. In the highly transmissible Delta variant, the group has found, greater than 75% of spikes are primed to infect a human cell. Known unknowns The scientific community is still scratching the surface of its understanding of SARS-CoV-2. Key unknowns include the number of ACE2 receptors needed to bind to each spike protein; when exactly the S2 site is cleaved by TMPRSS2; and the number of spikes needed for virus–cell membrane fusion, says McLellan — and that’s just for entry. In April 2020, a team at the University of California, San Francisco, identified at least 332 interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins25. It is not easy to keep pace with the quickly mutating virus. Most mutations so far are associated with how effectively the virus spreads, not with how much the virus damages the host, experts agree. This month, a study reported that the Delta variant grew more rapidly and at higher levels inside people’s lungs and throats than did earlier versions of the virus26. But it is not yet certain how Delta’s mutations have supercharged the variant in this way, says Stern-Ginossar. “This is something many labs are trying to figure out.” Nature 595, 640-644 (2021) doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-02039-y References Casalino, L. et al.

15," Pride 50 NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT UK ‘on cusp of herd immunity as 87% of us have Covid antibodies’ Scientists believe the UK may be close to achieving herd immunity against coronavirus as weekly case numbers continue to fall. There are hopes the end of the third wave may now be in sight after experts at University College London calculated the total population’s immunity is at 87%, MailOnline reports. The current threshold for herd immunity is 93% due to the contagious delta variant – which was originally detected in India – making the virus more transmissible. Dr David Matthews, a virologist and coronaviruses expert from the University of Bristol, told The Telegraph: ‘In terms of herd immunity – by which we mean the virus has managed to reach everybody and therefore most people will have a level of immune memory – I suspect we’re very close to it. ‘Assuming nothing truly spectacularly leftfield happens then this pandemic is pretty much over for the UK. I suspect we will not see a major surge this winter, or any serious levels of fatalities. ‘The more we close the gap on the last 10% who haven’t had the vaccine the better we will be. Everyone will eventually meet the virus and it is far better to do so vaccinated.’  His comments come after scientists initially predicted infection numbers could soar to more than 100,000 a day after the lifting of restrictions, with another lockdown needed by the autumn. One key Government adviser suggested cases could even reach 200,000 a day. But Department of Health data from yesterday revealed infection rates are falling in every age group in England – and dropping fast among under-30s in particular. The UK recorded another 27,734 Covid-19 cases yesterday, which was the first increase in a week.  But cases over the last seven days are still down by 120,000, or a 36% decrease, compared to the previous week.  Hospitalisations and deaths did however increase by a quarter week-on-week. Scientists have been left baffled by the fall in cases in contrast to their predictions, but believe testing may be involved, with schools closed for the summer and people not wanting to take tests before going on their holidays. Two key announcements from the Government lifting restrictions further were also revealed yesterday. Reports suggest double-vaccinated people will not be legally obliged to take a coronavirus test to avoid self-isolation from August 16. It is hoped these measures will put an end to the ‘pingdemic’ chaos in recent days. And from Monday fully vaccinated travellers from the US and EU will be allowed to enter England from an amber list country without self-isolating. The prime minister is said to have been persuaded to reopen foreign travel to make the most of the benefits of the vaccine rollout. A Government source said: ‘Some people will doubtless say we are moving too fast. But we know the vaccines are effective – if we cannot open up to fully vaccinated travellers then when can we? CDC director calls for agency overhaul after 'slow and confusing' Covid response 'My baby arrived so fast I had to give birth by myself in the bath - it was easy' UK approves new 'once a year' Covid jab in world first ‘The EU is already reopening to travellers from the US – why should American tourists be able to go to Paris or Amsterdam, but not London?’ But Downing Street has played down suggestions that the end of the pandemic is in sight, and Boris Johnson has remained cautious in his comments. ‘No one here is declaring mission accomplished,’ the source added. An expert told Metro.co.uk yesterday it is a ‘mistake to assume that we ever will reach herd immunity’ and that the coming winter months are likely to put hospitals under more pressure.

UK Covid cases rise for first time in a week
                                                                                                      Amanda Pritchard is to become the new chief executive of the NHS in England on Sunday, when Sir Simon Stevens steps down. Ms Pritchard said she is ""thrilled"" to be the first woman to head the health service in England and pledged to ensure diversity and inclusion are at the ""core"" of the NHS. She said that the ""can do"" attitude of NHS staff would help the health service to overcome some of the challenges it faces, including a third wave of Covid-19 and an unprecedented backlog of care, with more than five million on the waiting list for treatments. Bear statues in Sheffield that were installed to raise money for the city's children's hospitals have been vandalised with QR code stickers that lead to anti-vaccination websites. Those behind the statues wrote on Twitter: ""Someone has been sticking QR codes to our Bears. These aren't from us so please don't scan them. We're working beary hard to get them taken off."" Oh paws! Someone has been sticking QR stickers to our Bears.These aren’t from us so please don’t scan them. We’re working beary hard to get them taken off 🐻 https://t.co/wa1exf2qjW On July 7, a group of 122 scientists and doctors warned in a letter in The Lancet that population immunity would not be reached in time to prevent hundreds of thousands of new infections, and called for restrictions and mask wearing to remain indefinitely. However, far from a soaring wave of infections that could pass 200,000 a day, it looks like Britain peaked at around 60,000 cases on July 15. Although cases rose for the first time in seven days on Wednesday, infections have decreased 36 per cent in a week with daily figures less than half of the peak. Scientists say they are “puzzled” by the recent drop, blaming it on the heatwave, school closures, the Euros tournament ending, or a decrease in testing. It may even be the result of the “pingdemic” causing mass isolation and lowering transmission, they say, or else people are no longer being tested for fear of missing holidays. Tanzania has delivered its first Covid-19 vaccine doses, with president Samia Suluhu Hassan publicly receiving a jab and urging others to follow suit. President Hassan, who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, expressed confidence in the safety of vaccinations and said the country will pursue more. The US announced on Saturday the delivery of more than 1 million doses through the Covax global programme. Her late predecessor president John Magufuli had frequently expressed Covid-sceptic opinions, including a refusal to share virus data, and insisted the pandemic could be overcome with prayer.  Scotland has confirmed that fully-vaccinated travellers from the EU and US will not have to quarantine from Monday. The decision comes shortly after England announced the same rule change. Japan has reported 3,177 new cases of Covid-19 in capital Tokyo - setting an all-time high that exceeds 3,000 for the first time. The Olympic Games began in the city on Friday despite widespread criticism from members of the Japanese public who feared the international event could lead to outbreaks of the virus. The UK's live music industry has welcomed the news that fully-vaccinated travellers from the EU and US will no longer need to quarantine when arriving in England from August 2. The move will allow international musicians to perform at English festivals this summer, with it coming shortly after Queens of the Stone Age had pulled out of their slot at Reading and Leeds citing ""restrictions and logistics"". Greg Parmley, the chief executive of Live, which represents the interests of the live music business, including 4,000 artists and 2,000 backstage workers, said: ""We are extremely pleased to see that Government has taken the decision to allow people into the UK without the need to quarantine, if they have been fully vaccinated in Europe or the USA. ""This will allow international artists to perform at our world-leading festivals and venues over the coming months and will provide a vital boost to our iconic live music industry as we come out of lockdown."" The bulk of nine million coronavirus vaccines donated by the UK to developing countries in the coming weeks will expire at the end of September, raising concerns that many of the doses will go to waste. On Wednesday the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, announced that Britain will begin delivering nine million AstraZeneca shots this week, as part of a broader pledge to donate 100 million surplus vaccines by June 2022. Roughly five million of these vaccines will be sent to the Covax distribution scheme, while the remainder will be given directly to more than a dozen countries – including 817,000 doses to Kenya, 600,000 to Indonesia and 300,000 to Jamaica. “We’re doing this to help the most vulnerable, but also because we know we won’t be safe until everyone is safe,” Mr Raab said. But, though the donations have been widely welcomed amid vast inequalities in global distribution, there are mounting concerns that the vaccines’ short shelf life could undermine the rollout of the vaccines. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Twitter that officials would introduce a mandate for all state employees to either be vaccinated against Covid-19 or submit to regular testing. #BREAKING: New York State will mandate all state employees either be vaccinated or get tested regularly.We are working with the state unions to implement this program quickly & fairly. Will take effect by Labor Day. The White House is strongly considering requiring federal employees to show proof they've been vaccinated against the coronavirus or otherwise submit to regular testing and wear a mask - a potentially major shift in policy that reflects growing concerns about the spread of the more infectious delta variant. The possible vaccine mandate for federal employees - regardless of the rate of transmission in their area - is one option under consideration by the Biden administration, according to a person familiar with the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss deliberations that have yet to be made public. President Joe Biden suggested Tuesday that expanding that mandate to the entire federal workforce was ""under consideration,"" but offered no further details. The Department of Veterans Affairs on Monday became the first federal agency to require vaccinations for its health workers. The UK has recorded 27,734 new cases of Covid-19 and a further 91 deaths within 28 days of testing positive for the virus, official Government data shows. South Africa plans to spend around 36 billion rand ($2.4 billion) on relief measures to support businesses and individuals affected by Covid-19 restrictions and riots and unrest earlier this month, the finance ministry said. Edgar Sishi, acting head of the budget office, said increased revenue linked to higher commodity prices meant 36.2 billion rand of new spending could be accommodated ""so long as those measures are temporary"". The largest component of the relief package is the reinstatement of a 350 rand-a-month social relief grant, set to stay in place until the end of March 2022. State insurer Sasria will get 3.9 billion rand to help pay out claims related to the unrest, 2.3 billion rand will be spent on helping businesses not covered for civil unrest, and a tax incentive will be expanded by 5 billion rand to encourage employers to hire and retain staff. Sajid Javid, who tested positive for Covid-19 despite being fully-vaccinated, said the vaccine is ""the reason that I'm here today"" and urged more young people to get inoculated. The Health Secretary told the PA news agency: ""My own experience, I think, is a good example, a reminder really, that by getting vaccinated you do absolutely reduce your own chances of getting a positive test result, of course, but you can still get the virus. ""But there's no doubt that the reason that I'm here today, some 10 days after I had that positive test result, feeling absolutely fine, is because of the vaccines. ""My symptoms have been very mild and the latest information we have is that the vaccines in the UK, they've stopped 11 million infections, they've stopped 57,000 people from going to hospital and 37,000 people from dying. ""The vaccines are working."" He also said young people should think of vaccines as a ""liberating"" way of protecting yourself and your loved ones, and would help the return to normality.  Joss Croft, the chief executive of tourism group UKinbound, said the removal of quarantine for fully-vaccinated US and EU visitors to England is a ""fantastic step forward"". He added that ""businesses that are reliant on international visitors still face substantial barriers to recovery, having had virtually no business since March 2020"". Sean Doyle, the chief executive and chairman of British Airways, said the move will ""allow us to reunite loved ones and get Global Britain back in business"". John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow Airport, said the Government had made the ""right decision to safely further reopen international travel. We will now work with colleagues in the industry to boost UK trade, reunite family and friends, and generate billions in new tourist income"". More countries have been included in the Government's quarantine exemption for fully-vaccinated US and EU travellers. People travelling to England from Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein - all members of the European Free Trade Association - as well as those coming from Andorra, Monaco and Vatican City, will also be included in the quarantine exemption if double-jabbed. England will allow US and EU travellers who are fully-vaccinated against Covid-19 to enter without the need to quarantine. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced that the new rules will be in place from 4am on Monday August 2. He said: ""We've taken great strides on our journey to reopen international travel and today is another important step forward. ""Whether you are a family reuniting for the first time since the start of the pandemic or a business benefiting from increased trade - this is progress we can all enjoy. ""We will of course continue to be guided by the latest scientific data but thanks to our world-leading domestic vaccination programme, we're able to look to the future and start to rebuild key transatlantic routes with the US while further cementing ties with our European neighbours."" It has not been announced whether the change will apply to people arriving in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Vaccine equity campaigners have called the Government's vaccine donations ""shamefully inadequate"" and ""shoddy PR"". The Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab today announced 100 million vaccine doses would go to Commonwealth and ""vulnerable"" poorer countries around the world by next June. Nick Dearden, Director of Global Justice Now, said: “Britain’s donations today are shamefully inadequate. And the Government wants to use this as a form of diplomacy, offering many doses on the basis of their strategic interests. This is a global health crisis, not an opportunity for vain self-promotion. “Worse still, this shoddy piece of PR went out on the very day the UK is blocking real solutions at the World Trade Organisation that would allow many of these countries to produce their own vaccines in far greater quantities than donations will ever achieve."" Zimbabwe has authorised Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, making it the first jab produced in the West to be approved by the African nation. Until the approval, the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ) had only registered coronavirus vaccines from India, Russia and China. More than 1.5 million people in the country have received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, with most being given China's Sinovac and Sinopharm shots. MCAZ spokesman Shingai Gwatidzo refused to say when Zimbabwe would receive its first J&J doses, but said the health ministry would confirm the shipping of the vaccines after reviewing requirements for cold chain storage. The country has paid for a total of 12 million vaccine doses from China, and is set to receive 5 million shots under the African Union vaccine procurement facility (following a deposit payment of £7.5 million) and a further 1.15 doses from the Covax programme. The significance of the Government's decision to allow fully-vaccinated travellers from the US and the EU to enter England without the need to self-isolate cannot ""be overestimated"", a travel industry expert has said. Paul Charles, the chief executive of travel consultancy firm The PC Agency, said the move will ""pump vital cash into the travel economy, and help salvage the rest of the summer"". He said it is ""especially good news for our airlines who need to fill their seats across the Atlantic"" and hopes the ""news will encourage millions of extra visitors to the UK at a time when the sector badly needs them"". He added that while the decision is ""welcome"", it ""should have been made weeks ago"". Pfizer has raised its forecast for 2021 full-year sales of its Covid-19 vaccine, that it jointly developed with Germany's BioNTech, by nearly 29 per cent to $33.5 billion. The company also said that it could apply for an emergency use authorisation for a potential booster shot as early as August. The raised sales forecast of the vaccine is based on signed deals for 2.1 billion doses, and the company could increase it if it signs additional contracts. Eight out of the 10 highest paid civil servants in the Department of Health and Social Care during the first quarter of the year worked for NHS Test and Trace, with seven of them on more than the department’s permanent secretary. Government transparency data for the first quarter of 2021-22 released last week shows senior officials at NHS Test and Trace were on the highest salaries in the DHSC. Five Test and Trace directors were on a salary of at least £200,000, including Ben Stimson, who was chief customer officer, on £240,000, until he left in May; Gareth Williams, formerly chief people officer and now chief operating officer, on £240,000; and Simon Bolton, then chief technology and information officer, on £200,000 — who left in June to become NHS Digital interim chief executive, where he also earns between £200,000 and £205,000, among others. The news comes after the Government decided not to give a pay rise to senior managers in the NHS in line with other, more junior colleagues who got a 3 per cent increase. Premier League football team Norwich City have confirmed a number of positive Covid tests among the squad. The team's pre-season friendly against Coventry on Wednesday evening has now been cancelled as a result. A Norwich statement said: ""The decision was made as a precautionary measure following a small number of positive Covid-19 test results within City's first team group. ""The club's players and staff will continue to follow Premier League protocols and government guidelines, operating and training in their respective first team bubble at the Lotus Training Centre."" Volunteers in Thailand turned a cargo warehouse at Bangkok's Don Muang Airport into a 1,800-bed field hospital for Covid-19 patients with less severe symptoms, as the country continues to battle a surge in cases. Rienthong Nanna, director of Mongkutwattana Hospital, told Reuters: ""This is a level one field hospital where it can receive a large number of patients, who have less severe symptoms. But if patients' conditions deteriorate, they will be moved to our other field hospital, called Pitak Rachan."" Rienthong, a retired major-general and an ultra-royalist leader, said the field hospital was not yet up and running as more preparations were needed. The country reported a daily record of 16,533 new cases on Wednesday, plus 133 new deaths, bringing the total number of cases to 543,361 and 4,397 deaths. The UK Emirates boss said it is ""frustrating"" that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is still on the red travel list, meaning that passengers travelling from the Gulf state to the UK must enter a quarantine hotel for 11 nights at a cost of £1,750. Richard Jewsbury, the divisional vice president, said he hopes low coronavirus cases and a strong vaccine rollout will see the state, which includes the popular tourist cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, soon removed from the red list. Mr Jewsbury said: ""All we can do is stay engaged and flag up the data and hope that it's acted upon."" Yangon, Myanmar Sydney, Australia  Tokyo, Japan A single dose of a Covid-19 vaccine offers as much protection against severe illness to people who were shielding during the pandemic as it does for the rest of the population, a study has found. Researchers from Public Health Scotland and the University of Edinburgh said there had been concerns that a weakened immune system may reduce the effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines. They used data from over 100,000 people to assess its impact on reducing severe forms of the disease among the clinically extremely vulnerable. The results showed the efficacy of a single vaccination dose in protecting against severe Covid-19 was as high or higher in those eligible for shielding - but there was not enough data to judge the vaccine's effect on those who have received a solid organ transplant. Dr Nicholas Phin, director of public health science at Public Health Scotland, said the results were ""hugely encouraging"". He added: ""However, caution is still needed. Restrictions continue to ease and case rates remain high, meaning that all people, especially those who are at most risk, should continue to take extra precautions until fully vaccinated with two doses."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the Government has committed to providing 100 million doses from surplus domestic supply to the ""poorest and most vulnerable"" countries, and Commonwealth allies, by next June. Part of the first batch, consisting of nine million Oxford/AstraZeneca doses, will start going out to the Covax programme from Friday. Mr Raab said: ""We succeeded in double-vaccinating 70 per cent of the adult population, the UK economy is bouncing back but we know we're not going to be safe in the UK until everyone is safe. ""That is why we have been leading the (international) vaccine rollout to give enough doses to get the world vaccinated by the middle of next year, rather than the current trajectory, which is the end of 2024. ""The first nine million doses will be going on Friday to countries from vulnerable countries in the Indo-Pacific, such as Laos, Cambodia, key partners like Indonesia, right the way through the Commonwealth countries from Kenya to Jamaica."" According to a poll conducted by YouGov, 63-66 per cent of people agree with allowing fully-vaccinated visitors from key European countries into England. This includes those from Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Italy and France. Meanwhile, 58 per cent of respondents support letting in fully-vaccinated visitors from the US. Later today the government is expected to approve allowing fully vaccinated European and US tourists to enter EnglandMost Britons would support such a move - 63-66% back allowing vaccinated visitors from key European nations, and 58% from the US https://t.co/tO98lzTifg pic.twitter.com/8xjWhP1UZj The number of coronavirus deaths has increased by a fifth in the last week, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organisation. In its weekly Covid update the WHO reported there had been 69,000 deaths globally in the last seven days - an increase of 21 per cent since the last report.  The largest number of deaths took place in the Americas and South East Asia.  The report also showed that cases are rising again around the world - 3.8 million cases were reported in the last week, an eight per cent increase on last week's figure.  There have now been almost 194 million cases of the disease since the pandemic began and the number could exceed 200 million if cases rise at the current level. The countries seeing the largest number of new cases this week were: the US with 500,000 new cases (131 per cent increase); Brazil 324,000 new cases (13 per cent increase); Indonesia, 289,000 new cases (17 per cent decrease); the UK, 282,000 new cases (five per cent decrease); and India, with 265,000 new cases, a similar number to the previous week.  The Government said the UK will offer 817,000 Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines to Kenya, with the first 400,000 doses set to be sent this week. Boris Johnson will meet Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta at Chequers today for talks, with the proposed vaccine deal part of a delivery of nine million doses through the global Covax scheme and directly to individual countries. The Prime Minister said: ""As friends and allies, we are sharing UK vaccine doses to support Kenya's fight against the pandemic."" Unvaccinated French secondary school pupils will be 'ousted' from the physical classroom if a classmate tests positive for Covid-19 this autumn, the education minister announced on Wednesday. Pupils aged 11 to 18 who are not fully vaccinated will be obliged to follow classes remotely while their colleagues continue attending physical lessons, said Jean-Michel Blanquer. As for primary schools where pupils cannot be vaccinated, classes will be shut as soon as one positive case is detected, he added. ""Our compass remains to keep open the school system,"" said Mr Blanquer. Half of the population (around 34 million people) is now fully vaccinated, the French health minister announced on Tuesday, adding the government hopes to raise the number of people who have received at least one dose to 50 million by the end of next month. To speed up jabs among 12 to 17-year-olds, between 6,000 to 7,000 vaccination centres will be deployed ""in or next to"" schools, Mr Blanquer said. By Henry Samuel in Paris A deaf woman who took High Court action after complaining about a lack of British Sign Language interpreters at Government Covid briefings in England has won a compensation fight. Katie Rowley, who is in her 30s and from Leeds, took legal action against the Cabinet Office. Ms Rowley said the Government has breached obligations to make broadcasts accessible to deaf people under equality legislation. Ministers disputed her claim and lawyers representing the Cabinet Office said it should be dismissed. The coronavirus pandemic has forced a “real reset” in efforts to ensure that all children around the world are able to go to school, according to Sierra Leone’s charismatic minister for education. Speaking to The Telegraph ahead of a global education summit hosted in London by the UK and Kenya on Thursday, Dr David Moinina Sengeh said that while the pandemic has wrought havoc, it has also forced unprecedented innovation and “out of the box” thinking. He is confident that the world may reach ambitious targets – set out by the United Nations in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – to achieve “inclusive and equitable quality education” for children worldwide by 2030. “Before Covid, we would have definitely failed. And at the peak of Covid, it seemed like we’re all doomed… but I think Covid is the real reset,” Dr Sengeh said. “It’s not good that Covid happened, but because of Covid and because all of our children were out of school, it woke us up… it forced everyone to take a look at themselves and we didn’t like what we saw.” Sarah Newey and Anne Gulland have more details here. Mike Tildesley, professor of infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, said Covid-19 ""isn't necessarily all over bar the shouting quite yet"". The member of scientific modelling group Spi-M told Times Radio: ""I think people are aware that Covid isn't quite over. ""I really hope that this is the turnaround of the third wave and as we get towards the autumn we really are very much getting back to normal. ""But I think, actually, people are doing pretty well at using their own judgment and exercising caution when necessary. ""It's pretty clear that we are not back to kind of pre-pandemic levels of mixing - people aren't socialising in the same way they were before the pandemic, hopefully that will come. ""But I think that's probably partly what we're seeing in the data - that we're not seeing a big surge in infections because people are taking a little bit of time to get back to normality."" He added that the high level of protection from the vaccines should put the UK in a ""better position"" in the winter, but added that it is possible a variant of concern could emerge. Mike Tildesley, professor of infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, said the recent falls in Covid-19 case numbers could have occurred because people are less willing to get a test ahead of summer holidays. Asked about the decline, the member of the scientific modelling group Spi-M told Times Radio: ""Because schools in England closed last week, we haven't got secondary school pupils doing regular lateral flow testing and so we're not necessarily detecting as many cases in younger people. ""It's also been suggested by some that, possibly, because of a high number of cases, because of the summer holidays approaching, people might be less willing to 'step up' to testing when they have symptoms. ""What we really need to do is monitor hospital admissions, because at the moment of course they're still going up - now, of course there is a lag when cases go down, it always takes a couple of weeks before hospital admissions turn around - but if we start to see as we get into August, if we start to see hospital admissions going down as well then I think we would have much stronger evidence to suggest that this third wave is starting to turn around."" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey refused to repeat Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove's comment that it is ""selfish"" not to have a Covid vaccination. Asked whether those not getting a jab are ""selfish"", she told LBC radio: ""I think there are still quite a lot of people who are still scared. ""We want to encourage people to recognise the vaccine is safe and actually will help them but also other people around them too. ""I just really want to encourage people to be positive about the benefits to them, but also to wider society. ""Taking the vaccine is a sensible, safe step forward."" Richard Walker, managing director of Iceland, said that after the number of workers getting pings surged last week, the numbers have mysteriously started to drop over the past couple of days.  He told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme: ""The pinging has started to drop. Now, our staff are law abiding citizens, but with all of that sick pay used up with peak holiday season, it feels to me like, potentially, they're starting to delete the app en masse in numbers that they weren't previously doing. ""And to be honest, who can blame them."" Asked if that was a relief to him, given that less of his workforce would be at home self-isolating, he said: ""I'm not I'm not condoning it, but I can understand why they are doing it. ""And, you know, this is, not law. This is government guidelines, but it has to be pragmatic and we're stuck. They're working so hard and have been nothing short of heroic throughout this pandemic. ""They deserve a break now but also business deserves clarity from Government and the pragmatic framework from which we can we can move forward."" Boris Johnson stressed the need for caution despite recent falls in the number of coronavirus cases. The Prime Minister told LBC Radio: ""We've seen some encouraging recent data, there's no question about that, but it is far, far too early to draw any general conclusions."" He added: ""The most important thing is for people to recognise that the current situation still calls for a lot of caution and for people just to remember that the virus is still out there, that a lot of people have got it, it still presents a significant risk."" One in four adults has not been huggedfor more than a year, a survey has found.  The research, carried out by Demos, suggests people are less likely to build new relationships, with 32 per cent of adults feeling there are fewer opportunities to do so than when the nation first locked down. But the thinktank's polling of 1,000 UK adults in May found that 23 per cent believed there are more opportunities as society opens up from Covid restrictions. It also showed that 64 per cent of respondents said they had not made a new friend for six months, while 44 per cent had not done so in more than a year. Thirty-seven per cent reported that they have not been hugged for at least half a year, while 25 per cent said they had not shared a hug for a year or more. A further 13 per cent said they have not been asked how their day was or talked to their neighbours in six months or more. The report called for public services to be delivered in a way that makes it easier for people to form new relationships. This would enable citizens to prevent problems and manage them more successfully with less reliance on the state, it said. The New South Wales state government said the lockdown of the city of 5 million would last at least until Aug. 28, after reporting on Wednesday 177 new infections in the latest 24-hour period. It was the largest daily tally since the cluster was discovered in mid-June. Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters: ""I am as upset and frustrated as all of you that we were not able to get the case numbers we would have liked at this point in time but that is the reality."" More than 2,500 people have been infected in a cluster that began when a limousine driver tested positive on June 16 to the contagious delta variant. The driver had been infected by a US aircrew he transported from Sydney airport. The death toll from the cluster reached 11 on Wednesday with a woman in her 90s dying in a Sydney hospital. The number of newly reported Covid-19 cases in Tokyo exceeded 3,000 for the first time, Kyodo News reported on Thursday, citing government sources. Japan has avoided the devastating outbreaks suffered by other nations such as India, Indonesia and the United States, but the fifth wave of the pandemic fueled by the delta variant is piling pressure on hospitals in the Olympic host city. Here is your Daily Telegraph on Wednesday July 28.  New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern receives her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine from nurse Gordana Nezich today in Hamilton, New Zealand. The New Zealand government will open vaccinations up to the general population, with people over 60 first invited to book an appointment. Millions of people are missing out on new working from home tax breaks, as the ""pingdemic"" has thrown plans of a nationwide return to the office into chaos.  Just 900,000 people have claimed the working from home tax allowance since the start of the tax year in April, Telegraph Money has learnt.  The allowance is potentially worth hundreds of pounds and is designed to cover the additional costs of working from home, such as higher energy bills.  Read the full story Vaccinated people in parts of the US where the delta variant is spreading rapidly should resume wearing face masks, the country's top health authority after previously scrapping the mask mandate. President Joe Biden said the announcement showed that America needs to ""do better"" on vaccinations, adding that a mandate for the country's more than two million federal workers was now ""under consideration"". Read the full story Governors of three prefectures near Olympics host Tokyo are likely to ask the government to declare states of emergency for their regions, media said on Wednesday, after Covid-19 infections spiked to a record high in the Japanese capital. Tokyo recorded 2,848 new cases on Tuesday, the highest since the pandemic began, and media reported authorities had asked hospitals to prepare more beds for patients amid a surge driven by the delta variant. Tokyo Olympics organisers on Wednesday reported 16 new Games-related cases, for a total of 169 since July 1. Olympic athletes, staff and media must follow strict rules to prevent the virus's spread, including frequent testing. The Tokyo surge may spell trouble for Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, whose support ratings are at their lowest since he took office last September, ahead of a general election this year. Suga on Tuesday urged people to stay home as much as possible and watch the Olympics on television. He said cancelling the Games was not an option. South Korea on Wednesday reported 1,896 new cases for Tuesday, its highest-ever daily increase, as the country struggles to subdue a fourth wave of outbreaks fanned by the delta variant. The daily tally broke a previous record set on July 22 as infections are spreading beyond the capital Seoul and its neighbouring regions where the toughest social distancing rules are in place. There were 1,823 domestically transmitted cases on Tuesday and 33.5 per cent, or 611, of the were from areas outside the capital regions, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). This is the first time the number of cases outside the Seoul metropolitan region has exceeded the 600 mark since the first Covid-19 wave emerged from a church in the southeastern city of Daegu. Australia's New South Wales state authorities on Wednesday extended a lockdown in state capital Sydney for another month after weeks-long curbs failed to contain an outbreak of the delta virus variant. Lockdown rules were due to end on Friday but restrictions will now run until Aug 28, state Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney. A total of 177 new locally acquired cases were detected in New South Wales, up from 172 a day earlier. The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has fully vaccinated 90 per cent of its eligible adult population within just seven days, its health ministry said Tuesday. The tiny country, wedged between India and China and home to nearly 800,000 people, began giving out second doses on July 20 in a mass drive that has been hailed by UNICEF as ""arguably the fastest vaccination campaign to be executed during a pandemic"". In April, Bhutan grabbed headlines when its government said it had inoculated around the same percentage of eligible adults with the first dose in under two weeks after India donated 550,000 shots of AstraZeneca vaccine. But the country faced a shortage for months after India, a major supplier of the AstraZeneca shot, halted exports as it scrambled to meet a rising demand at home as infections surged. Bhutan was able to restart its drive last week after half a million doses of Moderna vaccine arrived from the United States as a donation under the UN-backed COVAX programme.

17," Once a Covid success story, South Korea sweats through summer of Delta surge As infections soar to record highs and the vaccine rollout languishes, some fear there is no end in sight for the pandemic Park Eun-sun is facing the most challenging set of circumstances since going into business for herself in August of 2020. Having kicked off Nostimo, her restaurant in southern Seoul, during the coronavirus pandemic, Park has had to work harder to attract customers who were reluctant to eat out during a public health crisis, while complying with an evolving set of social distancing mandates that dictate how many diners she can host and when she can open her doors. Now Park is suffering through the toughest restrictions since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Due to an ongoing flareup in cases in the South Korean capital, restaurants must close at 10pm and can only have parties of one or two patrons for dinner service. “Although thankfully Korea has not gone into full lockdown, our fate so far has been influenced by government policy,” Park said. She is waiting for more of South Korea’s population to get vaccinated, a process she and many others have found frustratingly slow. “Since restaurants are still open, it would be nice if restaurant owners and employees would be higher on the priority list for the vaccine. Unfortunately this has not been the case,” she said. In the early stages of the pandemic, South Korea for a time had the largest outbreak in the world outside China. The country drew international admiration for quickly reining in the first wave of infections through an aggressive campaign of testing and contact tracing, all without ever enacting stringent lockdown measures like mandatory business closures. That sheen has come off, as more than a year later, South Korea is suffering through its worst wave of coronavirus infections yet, having logged 1,896 new cases on Wednesday, the country’s highest daily figure ever. The national government, led by President Moon Jae-in is the target of public discontent, with critics accusing Moon and the ruling party of congratulating themselves on those successful early virus containment measures while failing to secure sufficient supplies of vaccines to allow a return to normal life. South Korea currently ranks second-to-last among OECD member countries, with only 13.49% of its population fully vaccinated, and critics have argued that the government dragged its feet in rolling out the national vaccination campaign, leaving the public and small businesses to cope with near lockdown measures that have hurt the economy and quality of life. The government has signed deals with overseas providers to acquire AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but supply shortages and delayed shipments have caused hiccups in the rollout. “The current situation of strict social distancing could have been avoided if the government had taken a more long-term approach,” said Shin Eui-cheol, a professor at the KAIST Graduate School of Medical Science & Engineering. “One year ago, the number of daily cases was only about 100 and they were satisfied with that, thinking that we could just control the pandemic. They should have looked ahead and come up with a more active strategy to try to terminate the pandemic by acquiring enough vaccines much earlier,” Shin said. Adding to the discomfort, the current virus spike is coinciding with an extreme heatwave, with temperatures in South Korean cities having been in the mid- to high thirties amid high humidity over the past week.  Late July is also the customary peak of holiday season in South Korea, and pandemic-related strictures on travel have meant more people are either staying home or taking domestic trips instead of going abroad. To limit the spread of the coronavirus, in popular holiday destinations on the coast, local officials have banned access to beaches for set periods each day and banned eating and drinking on the beach. The social distancing measures and many companies’ work-from-home directives have left the streets of Seoul, a typically bustling city, empty. At Nostimo, Park prepares authentic Greek dishes, with many ingredients sourced from a farm outside the city. She says that with South Koreans unable to take trips abroad due to the pandemic, Nostimo has enjoyed strong demand from grounded travellers. “Our restaurant has benefited from visits by Koreans and non-Koreans alike wishing to have authentic international food experiences without getting on a plane,” she said. Throughout the pandemic, one group that has struggled has been the medical workers that have led the response to the crisis, often working long hours while risking exposure to infection. Doctors have fought with the government over pay and working conditions, and accused the government of taking credit for their work. “Doctors and nurses who have been treating Covid-19 patients have been under a lot of stress, nearing burnout status,” said Park Jae-young, a medical doctor and Executive Editor of the Korean Doctors’ Weekly.  Park said that instead of looking forward to a “post-pandemic era” medical professionals are bracing for a future where the coronavirus remains a part of their work and life. “Considering the characteristics of the coronavirus - its transmission power, mutation patterns, and the vaccination rate - it seems that we will live with its effects virtually forever,” he said. “It will be impossible for a very, very long time to come for tens of thousands of people to take off their masks and gather on a soccer field to cheer, or shake hands with strangers and have heated discussions in pubs.” Most popular Most popular","Wed, 28 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/29/once-a-covid-success-story-south-korea-sweats-through-summer-of-delta-surge,"Once a Covid success story, South Korea sweats through summer of Delta surge - The Guardian"
18," The useful illusion of Covid incompetence Jeanne Warren on how the UK government continues to avoid responsibility, and Sarah Sheils on 1919’s flu mutation I have long thought that incompetence was not a credible explanation for the government’s more extreme actions during the pandemic, so I welcome the article by two sociologists, Jana Bacevic and Linsey McGoey, which says that the government constructed a facade of incompetence, behind which it could manipulate events (The British government’s Covid strategy was never designed to manage the virus, 27 July). In particular, it initially refused the help of existing public health expertise in test and trace while liaising with Serco, Deloitte and others to set up a system (branded “NHS”) that channelled huge amounts of public money to private firms. This “illusion of incompetence” continues to allow the government to avoid responsibility for mismanaging the pandemic, while benefiting its cronies financially.

 Main Navigation Relaxed COVID-19 rules could open door to vaccine-evading variants, say experts 

By Nick Bostock on the 
        28 July 2021

        
     High levels of COVID-19 after the relaxation of pandemic restrictions will increase the rate of 'new variant evolution' and the risk of vaccine-evading strains of coronavirus emerging, a study has warned.   Relaxing restrictions at a time when the 'R' rate in the UK remains well above one leaves the country exposed to an 'unpredictable' risk around the potential emergence of dangerous new strains that could go on to increase the impact of the pandemic worldwide, the researchers warn. Writing in the journal Virulence, the researchers warn that 'the laissez-faire approach that many governments are now taking towards COVID-19 management, risks substantially increasing mortality and morbidity in the wider population'. The 'R' rate in the UK is currently around 1.2-1.4 - and the study warns that restrictions such as mask wearing can only safely be relaxed once it falls below 1, meaning that the spread of the virus is shrinking.

The study warns: 'The risk associated with large scale natural infection is not predictable because we cannot know the virulence characteristics and vaccine susceptibility of the new variants that will continue to evolve. 'With an increasing number of people being infected, the rate of new variant evolution of SARS-CoV-2 accelerates, increasing the likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 variants will acquire higher virulence and vaccine escape potential.' Lead author and editor in chief of Virulence, Professor Kevin Tyler from the University of East Anglia’s (UEA's) Norwich Medical School, said: 'Over the past 17 months, economies, education and mental wellbeing have suffered tremendously due to the restrictions imposed in an attempt to stem the spread of the pandemic. 'Although vaccines have weakened the link between infection and mortality, they should not be used as an argument to justify a broad change in policy for countries experiencing an exponential increase in infection numbers. 'Relaxing restrictions boosts transmission and allows the virus population to expand, which enhances its adaptive evolutionary potential and increases the risk of vaccine-resistant strains emerging by a process known as antigenic drift. Put simply, limiting the spread of COVID-19 as much as possible restricts the number of future deaths by restricting the rate with which new variants arise.' He added that new strains could also pose a greater risk or be more transmissible in unvaccinated parts of the population such as children - warning that it could become necessary to widen the vaccination campaign to children to prevent the spread of these new variants.  Co-lead author and evolutionary biologist Prof Cock Van Oosterhout, from UEA’s School of Environmental Sciences, said: 'We have an arms race on our hands.  'On the human side, the arms race is fought with vaccines, new technology such as the NHS COVID-19 app, and our behavioural change, but the virus fights back by adapting and evolving. 'It is unlikely we will get ahead in this arms race unless we can significantly reduce the population size of the virus.' The study warns that 'new variants could rapidly replace existing strains, particularly during the exponential growth phase of the infection' - and warns that public health policies proven to slow the spread of COVID-19 must be maintained.

20," Amid Tory chaos and confusion, Labour has a Covid recovery plan The real-world impact of this government’s lack of grip is all too clear, not least when it comes to the economy The chaos and confusion caused by this government in recent weeks beggars belief. Instead of clear, calm messages for the public, we’ve seen ministers change their position on self-isolation within a matter of hours. And rather than timely information for businesses, companies large and small have been forced to wait until just days before all legal restrictions were lifted to get the guidance they so badly needed. Hundreds of thousands of people are being forced to self-isolate, thanks to the prime minister’s recklessness, and his refusal to keep sensible measures in place to prevent the spread of the virus. These are difficult decisions. But no one looking objectively at this prime minister would get the sense he’s a man with a plan. The real-world impact of this government’s lack of grip is all too clear, not least when it comes to the economy. The UK had the worst economic performance in the G7 last year and isn’t bouncing back the way others are. The US has already reached pre-crisis levels of GDP per capita. The latest OECD outlook suggests Japan will be there in the autumn, and Germany early in the new year. The UK will not catch up until this time next year. Yet our economy will eventually bounce back, thanks largely to the businesses, workers and communities across Britain who have adapted in the most difficult of circumstances. As we look towards that recovery, we need to build an economy that makes the most of the huge potential we have as a nation. We have a chance to use this time to boost growth, and to learn the lessons this pandemic has taught us about our economy, our industries and our vital public services, environment and quality of life. A Labour government will do things differently. That’s why this week I set out five tests to ensure the government is delivering the national economy the British people deserve. The economy Labour wants to build is one where everyone has a secure job with wages they can raise a family on, a financial buffer when things go wrong, and opportunities to prosper – no matter where they’re from or what their background. These tests will help hold the government’s feet to the fire when it comes to delivering those aims. First, our British industries should thrive. This means an expansion of manufacturing output, jobs and exports, including in high-growth sectors of the future such as green technology and digital services. Labour would do this with our plan to buy, make and sell more in Britain, building the skills and jobs of the future that will help us succeed on the global stage. Second, people should have secure jobs and real choices around work. That means a stable income, growth in occupations that pay well but that you don’t need a degree for, and improved pay and conditions. Third, everyone should feel the benefits of higher pay and a lower cost of living. We need a reduction in the number of households, children and pensioners in poverty, falling levels of problem debt, and higher wages so that fewer people require in-work benefits. Fourth, no one and nowhere should miss out as the recovery takes shape. No matter where they live or what their background, everyone should be able to benefit from greater opportunities. And yet, despite Boris Johnson’s promises, the economic performance of the highest and lowest regions is forecast to widen over the course of this parliament. That cannot be allowed to happen. Fifth, the economic recovery must be sustainable. We need real, tangible progress towards our net zero goals, while building stronger, more resilient communities with greater wellbeing and falling rates of loneliness and social isolation. The pandemic has hit us hard – and in more ways than one. But the problems we face as a country go back far further than the last 18 months. Under the Conservatives, in the nine years running up to the pandemic, low growth lost us a potential £16.7bn in tax revenue. That’s money that could have been spent on our NHS, supporting our teachers, or maintaining police numbers. We face immense challenges individually, as a society, and as a country. Yet despite this government’s recklessness and disregard for the concerns of ordinary people, I know we will overcome them. Labour’s five tests set out a pathway to a stronger, fairer and more resilient economy where everyone can prosper – no matter where they live or what their background.

21," UK’s economic recovery from Covid stalled in June amid ‘pingdemic’ Our latest snapshot of key economic indicators finds shortages of goods and staff leading to slower growth Britain’s recovery from the pandemic slowed last month as shortages of goods supplied to factories, building sites and shops began to take their toll on growth and increasing numbers of workers across the country were forced to isolate after being pinged by the NHS app. According to the Guardian’s monthly snapshot of economic developments, there was a slowdown in economic growth in June, which could continue if the Delta variant continues to hamper business activity. Construction companies reported a second month of declining activity as the combined impact of EU staff returning home following Brexit and a shortage of materials hit their ability to maintain previously high levels. Overall retail footfall in mid-July was three-quarters of the level recorded in the equivalent week of 2019, prior to the pandemic, reflecting continued caution among shoppers as Covid infection rates remained high. Financial markets took a dive last week in response to concerns that governments were struggling to suppress the Delta variant and fears the highly contagious strain of the coronavirus would persist into the autumn. A more recent improvement in the infection rate following a halving of reported cases in the UK helped markets recover some losses this week. But analysts said the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee (MPC), which meets next week to set interest rates, was likely to maintain its base rate at the historic low of 0.1% over fears that the virus could flare up again. Central bank policymakers are divided about the likely path of the recovery, with deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden and external member Michael Saunders, a former City economist, saying it was time to begin withdrawing the £150bn stimulus injected into the economy this year as part of an £875bn quantitative easing programme. However, a majority of the nine-strong committee have argued in separate speeches for the plan to remain in place, leaving little doubt that the central bank’s policy of low interest rates and QE will persist following next week’s meeting. In a speech earlier this week at the London School of Economics, MPC member Jan Vlieghe said Britain’s economy was not out of the woods and the damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has been only partly repaired. Writing in the Guardian, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “The real-world impact of this government’s lack of grip is all too clear, not least when it comes to the economy. “The UK had the worst economic performance in the G7 last year and isn’t bouncing back the way others are. The US has already reached pre-crisis levels of GDP per capita. The latest OECD outlook suggests Japan will be there in the autumn, and Germany early in the new year. The UK will not catch up until this time next year.” For more than a year, the Guardian has tracked the economic fallout from the pandemic on a monthly basis, following infection rates, eight key growth indicators and the level of the FTSE 100. Faced with the deepest global recession since the Great Depression, the Covid crisis watch also monitors Britain’s performance compared with other countries. On our dashboard, figures show the number of workers on UK company payrolls increased in June by 356,000 as employers rushed to hire staff in preparation for the relaxation of lockdown measures on 19 July. The most popular jobs were in warehouses, transport and delivery roles and customer services. A mismatch between the skills of people on the unemployment register and a rising number of vacancies meant the number of employees remained more than 200,000 below its level before the pandemic, data from the ONS showed. Retail sales increased by 0.5% in June, but only after a surge in purchases of food and drink to accompany the European football championships, while house price growth fell in response to the government’s withdrawal of a stamp duty waiver on homes worth less than £500,000.

22," France is about to overtake the UK on Covid vaccination – Emmanuel Macron’s tough approach is working Having led the world vaccination, the UK risks – like the hare in Aesop’s fable – taking a nap in the final stretch of the race The tortoise is threatening to overtake the hare. Within three weeks, on current trends, France will have first-vaccinated more people against Covid-19 than the United Kingdom. And within two weeks, France (with almost exactly the same population) will have more fully vaccinated people than the UK. Several other EU countries, including Spain and Belgium, are threatening to overtake Britain in terms of jabs per head of population in the next few days. The UK vaccination drive – rightly the pride of the nation in the spring – has slowed to a crawl in the last month. France is now first-vaccinating an average of 330,000 people a day; the UK 44,000. France is completing the vaccination of 400,000 people a day; the UK 170,000. Some argue that this does not matter. Britain has already achieved an extremely high level of first vaccination – 88 per cent of the adult population, about 70 per cent of the whole population. It was always going to be difficult to reach the final few millions of the vax-resistant, vax-shy and vax-lazy. Covid infections are, in any case, falling fast. Senior ministers boast in private that Britain has already achieved “herd immunity”. Maybe. Maybe not. Self-isolation exemptions in favour of daily Covid tests will only work if face masks are mandatory The level of coverage needed to achieve herd immunity as more aggressive forms of Covid emerge is disputed by epidemiologists. In any case, complete vaccinations currently still cover only 71 per cent of the UK adult population. Second jabs have been stuck on a plateau of around 170,000 a day for weeks. Why so slow when France is managing more than twice that? Having led the world in anti-Covid vaccination early this year, the Government risks – like the hare in Aesop’s fable – taking a nap in the final stretch of the race. There is no such complacency in other European countries, especially France. They have introduced or are considering legislation to, in effect, coerce the vax-shy, unwilling and resistant. An existing French health pass will be extended from Monday 9 August. In future, no jabs, no fun. Only those who are double-jabbed, recently tested or recovered from Covid will have access to bars, restaurants or long-distance travel. Health workers must be fully vaccinated by mid-September or risk suspension or dismissal. My craving for a holiday is about more than sun, sea and sand – it’s to escape our small-island mentality Much has been written in the British press about the street protests that this policy has generated (with more demonstrations expected this Saturday). Less has been written about the extraordinary impact of President Emmanuel Macron’s decision – and it was largely his decision – on the vax-shy. Since Macron announced the new policy on 12 July, 4.7 million French people have been first-jabbed – 320,000 a day, double the previous rate. In recent days (weekends excluded) France has been first-vaxxing over 400,000 people a day. These figures put into context the estimated 160,000 people who protested across the whole country last Saturday. The French vaccine programme, after a slow start, had a strong spell from April to June. It then slowed as it reached the strata of vax-snubbing young or vax-resistant older people (inset). This is unsurprising, given that an Ipsos Mori survey of 15 countries in December found France to be the most vaccine-hesitant, with only 40 per cent intending to get the jab. Yet rather than accept this as an inescapable fact, Macron took out a big stick. He has been attacked by some in France as a slayer of liberty for doing so. An article in The Spectator accuses him of “infantilising” the French. But there is another way of looking at it. With the Delta variant threatening a fourth Covid wave, Macron took a courageous decision to push vaccination faster and further.As of Tuesday night, over 41 million French people had been first vaccinated. The figure in the UK (with the same population of around 67 million) is 46.6 million. Should Boris Johnson do-a-Macron and introduce a health pass in England? Yes. But the chances of him doing so are zero. To do so would be to admit that the UK vaccine roll-out, once so rightly praised, has been dozing in the final stretch.

						Why Taiwan Is Beating COVID-19 – Again                     How did Taiwan suppress this wave, even as Australia, Vietnam, and Singapore are struggling with an uptick of the virus? A vaccination center in Hsinchu city, Taiwan, July 16, 2021. During the pandemic, Taiwan went about business as usual. Schools were open, concerts were playing, theaters were packed. Restaurants were bustling, the economy was booming, and expatriates and overseas Taiwanese flooded into the island. Taiwan was among a group of fortunate countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, and Singapore, whose citizens went about business as usual as tight borders, strict quarantine rules, and excellent contract tracing kept the virus at bay. That enviable routine came to an end in mid-May 2021 when an outbreak of COVID-19 transmission upended everyday life. Yet, COVID-19 cases have fallen significantly in recent days. New cases per day have fallen from 535 on May 17 to an average of fewer than 20 in the past seven days. On July 26, Taiwan reported a new low of 10 cases of community transmission. How did Taiwan suppress this wave of COVID-19 transmission, even as Australia, Vietnam, and Singapore are struggling with an uptick of the virus? First, Taiwan doubled down on longstanding strategies of masking, quarantine measures, and contact tracing. Long before this wave, as early as April 2020, Taiwan had already instituted mask mandates on public transportation. The government extended the mask mandate to everybody on the island and required its citizens to wear a mask outside their home. Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Moreover, Taiwan extended its quarantine facilities for those entering the country from abroad to domestic COVID-19 patients. Many local governments began providing options for anyone testing positive to quarantine in a government-provided hotel or facility. The provision of quarantine facilities significantly reduced transmission of the virus within the family, thus reducing the number of cases in the community. Enjoying this article?

Democratic Taiwan, in its attempt to maintain civil liberties, eschewed the more invasive phone-based surveillance technology used by countries in the region. Instead, contact tracers leveraged the records of Taiwanese businesses who encouraged their patrons to leave their contacts either by writing them down on a piece of paper or scanning a business-provided QR code from an app from their phones. While these records were imperfect, they still managed to reduce transmission rates in conjunction with universal masking and enhanced quarantine measures while maintaining a high level of civil liberties. Second, the Taiwanese government was willing to listen to critics and change its policies in fighting the pandemic. Taiwan emphasizes surface and droplet-based transmission of COVID-19 over the global consensus that the virus could be transmitted through aerosols in poorly ventilated indoor spaces. Taiwanese authorities were reluctant to ban indoor dining in the early days of the outbreak, as they felt that measures such as social distancing and plexiglass installation would prevent transmission. However, after growing intervention from its diaspora and local expatriates who urged the government to restrict indoor activities, many local governments eventually banned indoor dining and restricting indoor activities. Incidentally, the mayor of the southern port city of Kaohsiung led the way in limiting indoor dining. His early move became critical in preventing any spread of the virus in Kaohsiung from Taipei and New Taipei City, which had substantial community transmission. Some local governments have continued to ban indoor dining partly for fear of criticism from voters, even though such a ban was lifted recently by the central government as cases fell. Finally, the ruling DPP government supported the high-profile purchase of BioNTech vaccines from Germany via a mainland Chinese company by a former presidential hopeful in the rival Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) after segments of the Taiwanese population expressed interest in obtaining those vaccines. Third, the Taiwanese people actively sought accountability from politicians in fighting the pandemic. Fighting diseases became a marker for good governance in Taiwan’s modern history, beginning from the colonial period, where Japanese medical officers sought to eradicate infectious diseases to benefit the colonizers, to the more recent period, where Taiwanese health experts criticized politicians for being too slow and unprepared in dealing with the outbreak of the SARS virus in 2003. In today’s context, the mayor of Taipei, Ko Wen-je, has been chastised by media personalities, politicians, and voters for his relatively poor performance in fighting the outbreak. They criticized Ko for not taking contact tracing and testing seriously enough to contain localized outbreaks at markets, for failing to establish a proper vaccine distribution system, and pushing the blame for the persistent community transmission on the ground to anyone but himself. Elected as a populist, the physician-turned-mayor saw his approval numbers for pandemic control falling almost 7 percentage points from June to July 2021, the most significant fall among all mayors. Ongoing criticism has spurred Ko to accept the help of medical experts from the CDC reluctantly. They have sought to improve anti-pandemic efforts on the ground with the assistance of the vice mayor of Taipei. Fourth, Taiwan’s media played an understated role in fighting the pandemic. Taiwan’s free-wheeling media, which traces its origins to the democratization of the media landscape in the 1990s, competed to provide the latest information on fighting COVID-19 around the clock. Despite some outlets promoting vaccine hesitancy through emphasizing alleged cases of deaths associated with WHO-approved vaccines, most television stations have modeled good behaviors in their broadcasts. Almost all variety shows and news programs have moved online or insisted that all guests and hosts wear masks and socially distance. These measures reflected the seriousness of the Taiwanese media in fighting the pandemic and modeling appropriate behaviors for their viewers, irrespective of their political leanings. Fifth, Taiwan reaped the goodwill it sowed in the early days of pandemics. Taiwan donated more than 51 million face masks to countries worldwide last year. Recipient countries, in return, have gifted Taiwan precious vaccines during this outbreak, which the country struggled to obtain due to geopolitical reasons. Japan has given Taiwan more than 3.3 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines, and the United States has delivered 2.5 million doses of Moderna vaccines to Taiwan in the last two months. Lithuania, Slovakia, and Czechia have also pledged tens of thousands of vaccines to Taiwan. With the vaccines it purchased from COVAX and the United States, Taiwan has inoculated 28 percent of its population with one dose of vaccine, a considerable leap from the 1 percent of the population before the most recent outbreak. Taiwan’s success may not last, given the virulent Delta variant may breach Taiwan’s borders as it did in Australia, Vietnam, Singapore, and elsewhere. But its experiences, both near and far, should put the country in good stead in dealing with future outbreaks. Global health experts should consider how Taiwan has successfully fought COVID-19 as a democracy, particularly in its incremental improvements on testing, tracing, and isolation without significantly compromising fundamental freedoms and civil liberties. Despite criticism from the opposition party, the government’s willingness to share its homegrown vaccine, developed with the assistance of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, has revealed Taiwan’s desire to be a responsible member of the global health community. Taiwan’s generosity in sharing masks, resources, and expertise reveals the urgency for Taiwan to be given an observer status in the World Health Assembly. Taiwan can help, and the international health community should facilitate such assistance in order to end the global pandemic. A previous version of this article mistakenly listed Slovenia, rather than Slovakia, as one of the countries donating vaccines to Taiwan.

24," Proof Covid is turning into a mild illness? Survivors who get reinfected have lower viral loads which make them less likely to become unwell or spread the virus By Emily Craig Health Reporter For Mailonline   Published:  13:03, 28 July 2021   |  Updated:  15:08, 28 July 2021      1.5k View  comments  Covid survivors who get reinfected have lower viral loads and are less likely to suffer symptoms, official data suggested today.  Scientists claim the figures — taken from an analysis of almost 20,000 Britons — are proof the disease is becoming milder. Studies show infected people who have lower viral loads are less likely to become ill and spread the virus.  Last April, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) began examining people who had been struck down with Covid to determine the risk of them catching it again. Of the 19,470 people they studied between April 2020 and July 2021, 195 went on to catch Covid for a second time.    This equated to just one per cent of people being reinfected.  The Office for National Statistics studied 195 Brits and found their average Ct value when they caught Covid for the first time was 24.9. The Ct value shows how much of the virus was present in the nose or throat sample, with a lower number equating to a higher amount of the virus. When participants caught Covid again, they had an average Ct value of 32.4, meaning there was less virus present in their sample RELATED ARTICLES Share this article People who have previously beaten Covid are now more likely to be reinfected because of the Indian variant, an official report has found. Public Health England said the risk was 46 per cent higher with the Delta variant compared to the previously dominant Kent 'Alpha' variant. The finding was based on real-world analysis of the third wave in England and looked at about 80,000 Delta cases. But even with the increased risk posed by the mutant strain, the numbers of Britons getting reinfected still remains low. Of the Delta cases PHE analysed over the past three months, just 1.2 per cent were identified as possible reinfections. The results follow a lab study earlier this month which found the variant was able to dodge antibodies from previous infection better than earlier strains. PHE said the reinfection risk was incredibly low in people who had recovered from Covid in the past six months. The agency looked at the PCR test results for a group of people, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, who had a positive Covid test at least 90 days earlier. There were 83,197 people who tested positive in the 11-week period of the analysis, of whom 980 were possible reinfections. Comparing the results to the second wave, it said the risk of being reinfected with Delta was 46 per cent higher than Alpha. The analysis adjusted for different variables including age and vaccination. Experts aren't sure how long immunity from previous infection from Covid lasts because the virus is so new. It is believed that for the vast majority of people, immunity lasts for at least six months. Today's report only looked at people who tested positive at least 90 days after their first positive swab and had negative tests between the first and second infection.  Government statisticians looked at cycle threshold (Ct) values of volunteers, and compared the average scores between the first and second infection.  Ct values show the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus presented in a swab sample taken, with a lower value equating to a higher viral load.  Only a quarter of those participants who were reinfected had a high viral load — considered to be a score below 30.  For comparison, two-thirds had a high viral load from their first test.  Overall, the volunteers' average Ct value at their first positive test was 24.9, while it was 32.4 for their reinfection. Among the group, 93 of them had symptoms the first time they were infected, while just 38 had symptoms the second time they caught the virus. Scientists say the findings are proof that immunity — from both jabs and natural infections — is kicking in.  Nearly 37.5million adults have had both doses of jabs made by either Pfizer or AstraZeneca. No vaccine is perfect and many people who are fully-inoculated are still at risk of getting infected.  But the current crop of jabs being used in Britain have drastically slashed the risk of infected people becoming ill.  Meanwhile, the spread of the virus through the population has allowed natural immunity to build up over time, too.   Nearly 6million people have tested positive for the virus over the course of Britain's three waves — but millions more will have been infected. Professor Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, told MailOnline we 'shouldn't be too surprised' by the ONS findings.  He said: 'These findings show past infection results in immunity that provides good, but not absolute, protection from reinfection, at least over a relatively short time period. 'Even in those people who were reinfected, the levels of virus in their nose and throat were lower compared to viral loads seen during a first infection. 'This suggests that their pre-existing immunity, whilst not preventing infection, does effectively dampen down virus replication second-time around. 'This is important because it means people reinfected are less likely to suffer serious disease, and also the chances of them passing on the virus to others is reduced.' He added: 'We think vaccines will produce even higher levels of protection, even in those previously infected, so I would still urge everyone invited to get both doses of vaccine. 'I don't think this is because the virus has become less virulent, it’s more to do with host immunity generated following infection.'  While high Ct values represent a low viral load, scores can vary over the course of infection and a single figure may not provide the most accurate picture. And not every score can be compared accurately because different labs might not use the same test.  It comes after a separate report last week claimed people who have beaten Covid are now more likely to be reinfected because of the Indian variant. Public Health England said the risk of reinfection was 46 per cent higher with Delta compared to the previously dominant Kent 'Alpha' variant. The finding was based on real-world analysis of the third wave in England and looked at about 80,000 Delta cases. Proof Covid is turning into a mild illness?

25," Intended for healthcare professionals Search form Covid-19: Evidence used to support mass lateral flow testing was flawed, experts say Read our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Experts in medical testing have expressed concern at the way data were collected in key studies that formed the evidence base for the use of the Innova lateral flow devices in the NHS. A paper analysing the devices’ diagnostic performance, published in the journal EClinicalMedicine on 29 May,1 concluded that they “have promising performance characteristics for mass population testing and can be used to identify infectious positive individuals.” Innova’s lateral flow tests were used in pilots of community testing for SARS-CoV-2 in England and subsequently deployed for mass testing of asymptomatic people as part of the government’s costly and ambitious “Operation Moonshot” programme.234 This was done under an exceptional use authorisation (EUA) from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, which covers only NHS rebranded Innova lateral flow tests used in the national mass testing programme. The EUA runs until 28 August. Innova’s device “shows good viral antigen detection/sensitivity with excellent specificity, although kit failure rates and the impact of training are potential issues,” said the paper, which was based on analyses by researchers at Public Health England’s Porton Down facility and the University of Oxford. But in a letter to EClinicalMedicine published on 15 July,5 members of the Cochrane Covid-19 Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group said that there were discrepancies between the report of the studies that was published in the journal, information presented in the researchers’ preprint,6 and data that the investigators provided separately to the Cochrane team. It said that the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) criteria, adopted by the Lancet journals, “have not been fully adhered to by this article.” “We have great concern that the evidence supporting the use of Innova for mass testing has not been obtained and reported with adequate attention to the scientific method required to provide a sound evidence base for policy-making,” the letter says. The Cochrane team requested clarification from the paper’s authors on several specific points (box 1). “1) The paper computes specificity by combining data on 6954 Innova tests across studies from ‘negative samples’ (Table 2). This implies all 6954 samples were verified by a reference standard which returned a negative result (anticipated to be RT-PCR, but no reference standard is described). The preliminary report indicated none of the 3985 participants in the school studies contributing to the estimate of specificity received RT-PCR or any other test to verify their disease status, and the data sent to the Cochrane team [to Jon Deeks] indicated that the 17 participants in the school studies who tested positive on the Innova assay were parallel-tested with RT-PCR. Can the authors clarify which students received a reference standard, and if so, what test was used and when it was done? “If full verification of disease status was not performed, computing specificity using a sample size of 6954 (rather than 2969) is not correct. Notably only 1852 of these samples appear to have been tested using dry swabs in line with manufacturer's instructions, so the relevant sample size is likely even smaller. “2) Of the 17 school samples reported to the Cochrane team as Innova positive, 14 were false positives as the RT-PCR test was reported negative. Whilst unable to compute sensitivity or specificity from these studies, knowing the numbers of test positives and false positives allows computation of a positive predictive value of 18% (95% confidence interval 4 to 43%). This important result is not reported in the publication or preprint. (The publication suggests 16 false positives and higher total numbers tested, so the exact value may slightly differ). The positive predictive value of school testing has been an important debate, particularly given school testing was originally introduced without RT-PCR confirmatory testing, thus its omission from this report is of relevance. Can the authors clarify that this result is correct and explain why it has been excluded from this report? “3) The authors report a specificity of 100% but no sensitivity value for the Armed Forces cohort. A full 2×2 table for this study was provided to and included in the Cochrane review—Innova was positive in 13 out of 46 who were PCR positive (sensitivity 28, 95% confidence interval (16 to 43%)). Why has this result not been reported?” On 22 July Lennard Lee and Tim Peto from the Oxford research team issued a response to the concerns raised, which was also published as a letter in EClinicalMedicine (box 2).7 “The main evaluation of the lateral flow devices is reported in the Phase 3 studies. The Phase 4 studies were designed to determine the feasibility of using lateral flow devices in different settings. As the disease prevalence at the time of these studies was very low, the Phase 4 studies were not powered to undertake a standard prospective evaluation of both positive and negative cases. “We are happy to confirm that all the samples shown in Table 2 had both a negative PCR test and a lateral flow test allowing the false positive rate to be estimated. PHE Porton tested the PCR samples collected from the school and armed forces studies. We agree that for the Phase 2 and 3 studies, lateral flow tests were done in laboratory conditions but overall 5942/6954 (85.4%) of the tests were done following the manufacturing instructions (rather than the 1852 suggested by the writers). “The writers refer to a personal communication providing Prof Deeks preliminary with the results then available. The current publication provides a cleaned version of the results. The specificity results from the very small Armed Forces study was included as we were interested in the false positive rate, at a time of lower disease prevalence. We apologize for not including in this paper the sensitivity results which we sent directly to Prof Deeks for the Cochrane Review. These show that the numbers (pos/total) were 8/8 (CT < 25); 3/4 (CT > = 25 to 28) and 2/34 (CT > = 28). As the disease was waning in the population at the time, the prevalence of low viral loads is not surprising and the low positive rate in such a population is expected and fits with the more complete Phase 3a results presented in our paper. “We do not consider that an overall ‘sensitivity’ of the test against a categorical PCR result, without accounting for viral load, is a useful measure of LFD performance as all studies confirm that the LFD test is normally negative in individuals with low viral loads. The author’s quoting of a sensitivity of only 28% and a positive predictive value of 18% at low disease prevalence is misleading, as already discussed as it assumes that the PCR test is a reliable test for infectiousness.” In addition to replying to the concerns about their data, Lee and Peto also defended the wide use, based on the evidence, of lateral flow devices in the UK and elsewhere. “Many thousands of infectious individuals have been identified and subsequently isolated successfully, breaking the chain of transmission,” they wrote. “For many, the return to a semblance of normal life has been facilitated by lateral flow tests.” They added, “There is no practical alternative as the PCR [polymerase chain reaction] test has poor specificity in identifying infectious cases, is inaccessible, expensive and has a slow turn-around rate.” In a statement the Lancet group said, “The STARD guidelines help improve completeness and transparency in reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies. Post-publication, scientific discussion, and debate are an important part of the scientific process, and the Lancet journals welcome responses from the wider scientific community to content published in our journals.” This article is made freely available for use in accordance with BMJ's website terms and conditions for the duration of the covid-19 pandemic or until otherwise determined by BMJ.

26," Pride 50 NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Long Covid could be caused by ‘viruses being reactivated in the body’ A group of scientists believe they are closing in on an explanation for what is causing long Covid.  Experts remain divided on why a minority of coronavirus patients suffer debilitating and wide-ranging long-term symptoms, while others recover relatively quickly or are asymptomatic. But there is increasing confidence among some that the reactivation of dormant illnesses like the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a major factor. If proven, the theory may help unlock treatments for long Covid, which has left some people suffering a host of horrifying health problems and unable to function for 18 months and beyond. A small study of Covid-19 patients published last month found a strong correlation between long-term symptoms and reactivated EBV – a virus thought to have infected some 90% of the global population. Two of the study’s authors have spoken to Metro.co.uk about the findings, which will raise hopes among long Covid sufferers that understanding of the mysterious condition is progressing. They found that just 10% of a control group had reactivated EBV – but more than six times as many long Covid sufferers tested positive. Researchers also believe that Covid-19 or the body’s response to it may reactivate other inactive or ‘latent’ viruses, too. Lead author Jeffrey Gold explained: ‘We found that two-thirds of the long Covid patients we tested were positive for EBV reactivation. ‘When we added a PCR test to detect circulating EBV DNA, we detected EBV reactivation in a few more patients. ‘This brought the total to more than 73% of long Covid patients experiencing EBV reactivation more than 90 days after they initially contracted Covid-19.’ More than a million people in the UK are believed to have long Covid but – like countless others worldwide – have been left searching for answers about why they are suffering and how to treat it. Warwick University’s Professor Lawrence Young, who was not involved in the study, told Metro.co.uk: ‘There is mounting evidence that the reactivation of dormant viruses might be contributing to long Covid. ‘One suspect is EBV, a very common infection that persists in our bodies and is usually silent.’ The researchers said EBV – which tends to present as a mild childhood illness – can be ‘serially reactivated’ – which might explain the relapses some long Covid sufferers report. The study of 185 patients suggested that few long Covid symptoms are likely to be a direct result of coronavirus, but instead ‘Covid-19 inflammation-induced EBV reactivation’. Professor Young, a virologist and professor of molecular oncology, continued: ‘There is evidence that EBV contributes to the initial clinical manifestation of Covid-19 as massively increased levels of EBV are found in the blood and this is associated with more severe disease. ‘EBV has been implicated in chronic fatigue syndrome, which has many of the features of long Covid.’ David Hurley, another author of the study, told Metro.co.uk that he had looked at reactivation of herpesviruses like EBV in the mid-1970 and said the range of symptoms were ‘similar’ to those seen in long Covid.  ‘My theory as to why herpesviruses (EBV specifically) may be part of the long Covid syndrome is that Covid-19 induces both a strong local and lasting systemic inflammatory response that is related to the promotion of “stress response”,’ he explained. ‘Reactivation of EBV (and most herpesviruses) is triggered by specific stress products.  ‘With extended period of stress (even in subclinical Covid disease), you can get a longer-term cycle of reactivation and a fair number of lasting “complex related symptoms”.’ He added that viruses such as HSV-1 or 2, HSV-6, herpes zoster, CMV and others can also be reactivated by the stress complex and may be responsible for a smaller number of cases. Claire Hastie, the founder of the Long Covid Support Facebook group which has more than 42,000 members, said some people in the community believe long Covid has caused the reactivation of viruses including shingles, herpes and viral hepatitis, as well as EBV. But the theory that other viruses are being reactivated is only one of a number of ideas about what causes long Covid – an illness some experts now believe is actually more than one condition. Other explanations include long Covid being a persistent immune response to Covid-19, which causes lasting inflammation; or that the initial phase of the illness damages tissue in some patients – or a combination of different factors. CDC director calls for agency overhaul after 'slow and confusing' Covid response 'My baby arrived so fast I had to give birth by myself in the bath - it was easy' UK approves new 'once a year' Covid jab in world first But another leading expert, Exeter University’s Professor David Strain, told Metro.co.uk that he felt Covid-19 itself lying dormant was a more likely possibility. He said: ‘I can’t say for certain either way. ‘Of the different theories I’ve seen, the one that is most plausible is that there is residual virus living in the gut. ‘Viral particles have been identified in faeces many months after the acute infection, and the gut is relatively immuno-privileged. ‘That would also fit with the observation that people seem to get at least transiently better after their vaccine, suggesting a boost to the main system helps alleviate symptoms.’ However, he conceded it was ‘possible’ that latent viruses contracted years ago being re-activated could be the reason. Heating and electricity 'will cost more than £100 a week by April' Met Office upgrades thunderstorm warning for London and South East to amber Protesters shout 'Tory scum' and accused of 'spitting at pensioners' at hustings Meanwhile, a researcher looking into Ebola ‘persisting’ in the body long after the initial infection, suggested worrying new evidence about the disease could also apply to Covid. Dr Janet Scott, a clinical lecturer in infectious diseases, at MRC-University of Glasgow’s Center for Virus Research (CVR), told Metro.co.uk: ‘There is good evidence that Ebola (also an RNA virus, albeit a very different one) persists for months to years in some individuals and continues to stimulate the immune system – I think this may contribute to the continuing problems Ebola survivors face [known as post Ebola syndrome]. ‘The most recent outbreak in Guinea – is thought to have started when an Ebola survivor from the 2014-16 outbreak unfortunately infected his wife.’ She added: ‘If it happens in Ebola, it is possible that it can occur in SARS-CoV2 [the virus behind Covid-19], although I have not yet seen a body of evidence to substantiate this for Covid-19 or long Covid yet. ‘It could be that Ebola is in the process of making a species jump to humans – in which case it’s one ball we should not be taking our eyes off of.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

27," UK Covid: 27,734 new cases as Welsh first minister criticises ‘risky’ travel plan for US and EU fully jabbed – as it happened This live blog is now closed. For the latest coronavirus updates from around the world, you can read our global Covid blog Live feed Early evening summary That’s all from me for today. But our coronavirus coverage continues on our global live blog. It’s here. Scotland follows England in lifting quarantine for fully-jabbed US/EU arrivals The Scottish government has said that it will match what England is doing and let fully vaccinated people from the US and the EU enter the country without quarantining from Monday. But, unlike the Welsh government (see 3.49pm), it is not saying that it is following the UK government with some reluctance. Instead, in his statement confirming the decision, Michael Matheson, the cabinet secretary for net zero, energy and transport, said this was possible because of Scotland’s successful vaccine programme. He said: This has only been made possible due to the overwhelming success of our vaccination programme here in Scotland when coupled with successful rollouts of vaccination schemes in the EU and US. Fully vaccinated travellers will be able to travel to Scotland under this significant relaxation of international travel measures, providing a boost for the tourism sector and wider economy while ensuring public health is protected. The Scottish government says the exemption will cover not just EU countries, but Efta members too, and the European microstates – Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City. Arrivals will be required to show either a EU digital Covid certificate and or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s white card, known as a CDC card. Amanda Pritchard is the new chief executive of NHS England, Boris Johnson has announced. Pritchard was deputy to Simon Stevens, who has just left the post with a peerage, and she will seen as something of a continuity appointment. She is a career NHS manager and her appointment is likely to be welcomed by some NHS chiefs who were worried about the job going to an outsider. Delighted Amanda Pritchard has been appointed as the new NHS Chief Executive, the first woman in the NHS's history to hold the post. I look forward to working closely with her.I want to thank Lord Stevens for his dedicated leadership of the NHS for the past seven years. Why Cabinet Office has welcomed court ruling against it over sign language interpretation at Covid briefings Earlier I posted PA Media copy about the government losing a court case about lack of British Sign Language (BSL) interpretation at Covid briefings. (See 2.22pm). But the Cabinet Office has put out a statement saying it is “pleased” about the ruling. This sounds confusing, and to explain why it is necessary to go into the case in a bit more detail. The Downing Street Covid press conferences have never included an in-room BSL interpreter, in the way that Nicola Sturgeon’s regular briefings in Scotland have. But the government says it raised this with the BBC and from March 2020 the BBC News channel reports included on on-screen BSL interpreter. In May the BBC started making a feed of this available to other broadcasters, and it was also available on social media. The government lost this case because this on-screen interpretation was not available for two particular data briefings. But the government feels vindicated because the complainant tried to get the court to accept that on-screen BSL interpretation was not sufficient, and that there should have been an in-room interpreter for all the briefings. The court rejected this argument. In its statement the Cabinet Office said: We are pleased that the court ruled our policy of using on-screen British Sign Language interpreters was lawful during the pandemic.  Our priority has always been to reach the largest possible audience with important public information and we will continue to ensure that British Sign Language interpretation is made available during Covid 19 briefings. What are the most recent test positivity figures? Here is a question from below the line worth addressing. @AndrewCovid positives are coming down thankfully but presumably so are the amount of tests since Schools stopped for holidays. Do you know the percentage of positive tests compared to the number of tests carried out over the passed few weeks? Can’t say it’s a number I have seen but think it is significant.Thanks This is a good question. Test positivity is the proportion of tests that turn out positive. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, was fond of quoting WHO guidance saying that anything above 5% suggests an outbreak is not under control. Positivity figures for England are included in the UK government’s Covid dashboard, but that are quite hard to find. You need to go into the page for testing, and set the tab to England. That will pull up this chart. The most recent figures go up to the seven-day period ending on 23 July. The Scottish figures are shown on a chart on its dashboard, and the actual numbers are in the data files. (See table 5, and one of the columns under the heading additional statistics (v) towards the end of the chart.) Wales has a positivity chart on the front page of its dashboard. And Northern Ireland has this positivity chart on its dashboard. The latest edition of the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast is out. Heather Stewart and Rafael Behr discuss “crime week”, as the government attempts to shift the narrative to domestic policies. Plus, Katy Hayward, Daniel Boffey and Jess Sargeant look at what’s behind the latest tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol. Daily Covid cases in UK rise for first time in eight days, to 27,734 The UK government has just updated its coronavirus dashboard and, after falling for seven days in a row, the daily number of new cases is starting to rise again. It says 27,734 have been recorded, up from 23,511 yesterday. But that is still well below the figure for this time last week, 44,104. And the total number of new cases over the past week is down 36.1% on the total for the previous week. The dashboard also says 91 further deaths have been recorded. Yesterday the equivalent figure was 131. But the total number of deaths over the past week is still up on the total for the previous seven days, by 36.1%. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told the BBC that countries like Norway and Switzerland (which are not in the EU but which are both in Efta, the European Free Trade Association) would also be covered by the exemption from quarantine for arrivals who are fully vaccinated. He also said that once this scheme was up and running, the government would decide what it could do for fully-vaccinated people from other parts of the world. UK decision to lift quarantine for fully-jabbed US and EU travellers creates risks, says Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, has warned that there are “risks” from the government’s decision to let fully-vaccinated people from the US and the EU visit England. Speaking to BBC News, he said that if it had been up to the Welsh government, it would probably have not agreed to this move. He said: We have said all along as the Welsh government that we would have taken a different approach to international travel. I still think this is the year when international travel is best avoided. We do not want to see in Wales a situation which we faced in September of last year, when the virus was reimported into Wales by people who have visited other parts of the world. We would have rather a more precautionary approach by the UK government and have done our best to persuade them of that. Given that they are making decisions that we probably wouldn’t have made for ourselves, it is very important that the UK government is able to offer us assurances that the risks that will be run - and there are risks whenever people visit from other parts of the world where the virus is in circulation, and where new variants of the disease may be emerging - that proper precautions are in place. Drakeford said that, for practical reasons, it would be very hard for Wales not to follow the UK’s government’s move, which technically only covers England. That was because most people coming to Wales from outside the UK would be travelling through English airports not Welsh ones, he said. But he also said that he would be challenging the UK government to show how it could be confident that people being allowed in were properly vaccinated. He went on: In the United States, for example, there are no vaccine certificates, as I understand. So, how will the UK government know that somebody travelling from the United States has been doubly vaccinated and that it has been done to the same sort of protocols and standards that we would expect in this country? We need to understand a little better than we do at the moment as to how that evidence will be collected and how that evidence can be provided in a way that we can all rely on. Drakeford is a Labour first minister, and earlier today Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the UK Labour party, said opening up the borders in this way was “reckless”. (See 11am.) When that was put to him, Drakeford said that his approach to international travel had been more cautious than the UK government’s all along. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said the changes to quarantine rules for fully vaccinated people from the US and the EU decided today will come into force from 4am on Monday. We're helping reunite people living in the US and European countries with their family and friends in the UK 👪 From 2nd August at 4am people from these countries will be able to come to the England from an amber country without having to quarantine if they're fully vaxxed 💉 The changes will apply to fully vaxxed people with an FDA or EMA vaccine 💉 - they’ll still need to do the usual pre-departure test before arrival and take a PCR test on day 2 of returning to the England. The FDA is the Food and Drug Administration, the US regulator, and the EMA is the European Medicines Agency, the European regulator. We're also able to confirm the restart of international cruises🚢and flexible testing programmes to help key workers and drive our economic recovery. Whether you’re a family or a business, this is progress we can all enjoy. UKinbound, a trade association representing companies working in the inbound tourism sector, has welcomed the news that fully vaccinated travellers from the US and the EU will not have quarantine when visiting England. Joss Croft, CEO of Ukinbound, said: Today’s announcement that quarantine will be removed for vaccinated US and EU visitors to England is a fantastic step forward that will allow the £28bn inbound tourism sector, which supports over 500,000 jobs across the UK, to finally restart. However, businesses that are reliant on international visitors still face substantial barriers to recovery, having had virtually no business since March 2020. Even with reciprocity, the valuable 2021 summer season is all but lost for inbound tourism, meaning thousands of businesses and jobs will continue to be at risk over winter.

28," Australia: Sydney remains in lockdown amid 'national COVID vaccine stockpile' Australia has faced difficulty rolling out its vaccination programme, with changing government advice on the AstraZeneca vaccine putting a strain on Pfizer stockpiles. 
          News reporter
              @megbaynes
 Wednesday 28 July 2021 15:26, UK Sydney will remain in lockdown for another month as officials continue to struggle to contain a growing outbreak of the Delta coronavirus variant. It comes as parts of Australia have been forced to go back into lockdown despite the country having three million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine stored, according to reports. Australia has relied to date on two vaccines - the AstraZeneca and Pfizer. However, fears about the AstraZeneca jab's side effects, including an increased risk of blood clots, has slowed the uptake of that inoculation. Live COVID updates from the UK and around the world Lockdown in the city of five million will continue until 28 August, after 177 new infections were reported in the latest 24-hour period. More than 2,500 people have been infected in a cluster that began when a limousine driver tested positive in June for the COVID Delta variant. He had been infected by a US aircrew he transported from Sydney airport.

                 The death toll from the cluster has now reached 11, after a woman in her 90s died in hospital. ""I am as upset and frustrated as all of you that we were not able to get the case numbers we would have liked at this point in time but that is the reality,"" said New South Wales state premier Gladys Berejiklian. Continuing lockdown restrictions mean members of the public are only allowed to leave their property with a reasonable excuse. Asked what he made of areas within Australia being in lockdown despite the country having vaccines available, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the PA news agency: ""We know that AstraZeneca is safe - it has been WHO approved, it has been approved by the European, the UK agencies. ""The vast majority of COVAX-distributed vaccines to the poorest and most vulnerable countries around the world today have been AstraZeneca. ""It is crucially important that people get the jab, whichever country they are."" While Australia has been relatively more successful than many other countries at containing the spread of the coronavirus - due to quick lockdowns, tough social distancing rules and swift contact tracing - it has faced difficulty rolling out its vaccination programme. The country has reported 33,474 COVID cases with 921 deaths, but figures show only 16% of adults is fully vaccinated. In the UK, 70% of people aged 18 and above have been given both vaccinations, with 88% offered one dose. This is in part due to Australia being reliant on the AstraZeneca jab while the government recommends people under 60 get a Pfizer vaccine over the blood clot fears. Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts,  Google Podcasts,  Spotify, Spreaker. This advice, issued on 17 June, has put a strain on Pfizer stockpiles, while concerns about AstraZeneca has contributed to some vaccine hesitancy. One of the world's most remote towns, Alice Springs - located roughly 800 miles away from the nearest city in Australia - has also been put into lockdown after a man travelling through the airport later tested positive for the virus. Now, everyone in the town has been told they need to stay at home for three days, only being allowed to leave for food, healthcare, exercise, work and to provide care for others.

29," GET YOUR COPY OF HOW WOKE WON  What about Covid in hospitals? Yet again, we are failing to protect the most vulnerable. The Covid data are looking good. Case numbers have declined every day for the past seven days, and the vaccine rollout has drastically weakened the link between infections and hospitalisations.  But some statistics tell a less happy tale. Data leaked to the Telegraph show that only 44 per cent of people classified as being hospitalised with Covid last Thursday had tested positive by the time of admission. In other words, more than half tested positive after going into hospital, some of them for causes unrelated to Covid. This suggests that significant numbers are catching Covid in hospital. We must not overstate the case. Of those who had not tested positive before admission, most tested positive within two days. Some of them will have undoubtedly caught the virus before entering hospital and will have been admitted for their Covid symptoms, only to test positive later. But we have known for some time that hospital-acquired infections are a serious problem. The NHS estimated that between early August 2020 and late March 2021, over 40,000 people probably caught the virus while in hospital. One study found that between March 2020 and January 2021 in Scotland, around 30 per cent of cases where people died or had severe illness from Covid could be linked to hospitals.  Covid is a highly transmissible virus and it is impossible to prevent its spread entirely. But it is clear that more needs to be done to get a handle on infections in hospitals. Like care homes, hospitals tend to be full of clinically vulnerable people. They are the last places in which we want the virus to spread. There are things that the NHS and the government could try to limit the spread. For example, epidemiologists Carl Heneghan and Tom Jefferson have previously proposed designating certain hospitals as so-called fever hospitals – specialist hospitals for infectious diseases. This would take Covid patients away from other hospitals, which could then focus on tackling the enormous backlog of non-Covid patients in relative safety. The largely unused Nightingale hospitals seem like ideal candidates for Covid treatment centres. Yet despite this alarming problem of hospital-acquired infections, most of the public debate is focused on low-risk young people going clubbing. The government plans to introduce vaccine passports for venues like nightclubs and events like festivals and football matches. It has also raised the prospect of forcing students to get vaccinated before they can go to university. Rather than tackling the bigger problem – Covid spreading among the most vulnerable – it wants to police young people’s behaviour. These misplaced priorities mirror the government’s catastrophic failure over care homes in the early months of the pandemic. While the general public were told to stay at home, hospitals were emptied of elderly patients in anticipation of an overwhelming wave of severe Covid cases that didn’t materialise. Thousands of vulnerable people were sent into care homes and many of them had not been tested for Covid. Some had even tested positive. Inevitably, the virus ripped through care homes, and by June around 20,000 residents had died from Covid. Deaths in care homes accounted for between a third and half of all Covid deaths at the time. Yet the authorities were far more concerned about people sitting on park benches and going for lone walks in the hills. Thanks to the vaccine rollout, Covid is on the back foot. But people can still get infected and ill, so we need to be ready for new variants and new waves. Society must be allowed to continue as normal, without lockdowns. And hospitals must be prepared to treat those who fall ill from Covid while minimising the risk to their many other patients. Protecting the vulnerable – not policing the young – must be our priority. Paddy Hannam is editorial assistant at spiked. Follow him on Twitter: @paddyhannam. Comment on

30," Fully vaccinated Brits reporting unique Covid symptom More than 37m people are now fully vaccinated in the UK Sign up for our daily newsletter to get the day's biggest stories sent direct to your inbox Thank you for subscribing! We have more newsletters Fully vaccinated Brits are said to be reporting different coronavirus symptoms. As of 4pm on Tuesday (July 27), 64,585 more people had their first dose of a COVID vaccine in the UK, taking the total to 46,653,796. A further 171,676 people had their second jab, meaning 37,459,060 are now fully vaccinated. Since the start of the pandemic last year, the symptoms to look our for have consistently been a new, continuous cough, a high temperature and loss of taste and/or smell.

They are also implemented to help prevent deaths or serious illness and have been proven to reduce the number of hospitalisations.  Now, new research from the ZOE Covid Symptom study found that vaccinated people who caught the virus reported 'only' one coronavirus symptom which differed from the main ones, Daily Record reports.  Researchers discovered that sneezing was the one symptom which was more commonly reported in vaccinated people with Covid-19, according to the King’s College London study in May. Other common symptoms in vaccinated people were: Researchers analysed data from participants logging their symptoms, tests and vaccines on the UK ZOE COVID Symptom Study app. They examined 2,278 adults who tested positive after vaccination and compared them to both vaccinated adults who tested negative and unvaccinated adults who tested positive. They wrote in the study: ""Generally, we saw similar symptoms of Covid-19 being reported overall in the app by people who had and hadn’t been vaccinated. ""However, fewer symptoms were reported over a shorter period of time by those who had already had a jab, suggesting that they were falling less seriously ill and getting better more quickly."" They added: ""Curiously, we noticed that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab."" They urged anyone who might experience sneezing after getting a jab to get tested for Covid-19 to make sure they have not contracted the virus. The study also lifted the lid on the risk factors that put people more at risk of infection post-vaccination. Individuals who had health conditions that limited their independence – such as frailty - were more at risk of coronavirus after vaccination, and of getting sick. Adults living in areas of higher deprivation were consistently at more risk of infection despite vaccination even when adjusting for health behaviours. Coronavirus infection in vaccinated individuals was less likely in individuals with a healthy lifestyle, for example a healthy diet and normal body mass index (BMI).

31," Covid-19: Tynwald agrees to create memorial 'garden of reflection' A Covid-19 memorial garden which would provide ""a place of quiet reflection"" is to be created on the Isle of Man. Jason Moorhouse MHK has called for a ""place to remember loved ones"" to be established in the next six months. However no firm timescale for the project has been fixed due to the ongoing pandemic.  A total of 29 people have died as a result of Covid-19 on the island, including 20 residents at Abbotswood Nursing Home. Mr Moorhouse suggested the garden should be situated in Ballasalla but Chief Minister Howard Quayle said it should be in a more central location. ""We have lost members of the community from across our island,"" he said.   Tynwald backed the garden and politicians supported an amendment by Mr Quayle to consider different locations. Politicians unanimously backed the amended motion, which means the next chief minister must report back to Tynwald on the cost of its development and a plan for future maintenance, by January 2022.

32," Covid patient numbers in Addenbrookes rise to highest since March The hospital said that the cases were adding pressure to the already stretched emergency services in the hospital. Sign up to our free email newsletter to receive the latest breaking news and daily roundups  Thank you for subscribing! We have more newsletters Addenbrooke's Hospital has 25 patients with Covid - the highest number of hospitalised cases since March. Cambridge University Hospital (CUH) Trust, which runs the hospital, was caring for 25 patients with Covid-19, with five of those in critical care, as of yesterday (July 27). The number of cases has risen steadily from last week. A week earlier, there were 11 Covid patients in Addenbrooke's and on the previous Tuesday, there were just six. This is a steep rise from June when the hospital consistently had Covid patient numbers in the single digits. From late May until the start of June, the hospital had none at all for the first time since September 2020.

The last time the hospital saw 25 patients was mid-March 2020, when the numbers were rapidly falling from the January 2021 peak. Dr Ewan Cameron, the interim chief operating officer, said in a morning staff briefing on today (July 28): ""We're seeing nationally some really significant increases in emergency pressures being felt in hospitals and emergency departments up and down the land ""Here at CUH, it's no different. We've now been in critical internal incident for I think nearly three weeks, really high pressure in the hospital and this morning is no different."" Addenbrooke’s Hospital announced on July 7 that it was at risk of becoming overwhelmed as more patients seek treatment for non-Covid conditions they had delayed addressing during the pandemic. Today (July 27), there were 75 patients, Covid or otherwise, in the emergency department this morning, which was an especially high number. This was having a ""difficult"" impact, he said. He added that some surgery was being cancelled, and the hospital was predominantly only performing emergency cancer surgery. Staff were also being encouraged to discharge patients were possible. Dr Cameron added that the situation would feel ""relentless"". He added: ""Whilst the link between cases and hospitalisations hasn't broken it has definitely significantly reduced. That being said, we have started to see an increase in the number of cases in the hospital."" He continued: ""Predominantly we're seeing younger patients who haven't been vaccinated and their length of stay has been shorter in most cases, as a result of that, but we are also seeing some older and vaccinated patients."" Adding that the link between cases and hospitalisations had been mostly broken, Dr Cameron continued: ""Vaccination is clearly making a massive difference but we could really do without 25 patients with Covid-19 in the hospital given the urgent emergency care pressures and we have seen an outbreak on a ward which means we've got beds closed again, as well as the risks to patients that obviously puts further pressures."" He added that staffing was ""really tight"" at the moment, due to a combination of vacancies, short term sickness, and then a lot of the pressures that Covid has continued to produce, such as self-isolating staff, which was putting pressure especially on small teams. Dr Cameron added that he was ""hopeful"" they would see fewer cases in the near future and that there was a ""light at the end of the tunnel"" due to the hard work of staff. A Cambridge University Hospitals spokesperson added: ""Although almost seven in 10 adults are now fully vaccinated, as we see a rise in Covid cases in the community once again, there has never been a more important time to get yourself protected. ""It remains the best way to protect yourself, your friends and your family, so particularly young people who are yet to come forward, this is the single most important thing you can do this weekend. ""Everyone aged 18 or over is now eligible for a lifesaving Covid-19 jab and the NHS is urging people to come forward as soon as possible. ""The NHS continues to send text messages to adults to remind them to bring forward their second jab forward to eight weeks, in line with updated Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation guidance. So far two thirds of all adults have had both doses and are fully vaccinated against coronavirus. ""People who attended a walk-in clinic for their first dose will have their vaccination record updated online and will then be able to book in their second dose appointment using the national booking system. ""Anybody who cannot go online can call the service on 119 instead to book their jab.""      Want the latest Cambridgeshire news direct to your inbox? Sign up here.

33," STEPHEN GLOVER: With Covid in retreat, now Boris Johnson must show what he REALLY stands for By Stephen Glover for the Daily Mail   Published:  23:37, 28 July 2021   |  Updated:  10:32, 29 July 2021      890 View  comments  What does Boris Johnson stand for? Does he stand for anything? Does he have strong political beliefs? He got Brexit done, it’s true, though at the cost of keeping Northern Ireland partly under the thumb of Brussels and within the Single Market, which could turn out to be too high a price. But since then he hasn’t had to reveal his hand because of Covid. The pandemic has dominated everything. It consumed most of the Prime Minister’s energy and time, and nearly took his life. Not that it can be said he has played a blinder. There has been confusion, contradiction and incompetence — as we have seen during the nonsense of the ‘pingdemic’. Without the triumph of the vaccine rollout, the Government would have scored three out of ten in my book. As it is, five? Now, though, even the normally grim ‘Professor Lockdown’ — aka Neil Ferguson — suggests that by October we may be looking back at the pandemic through our rear-view mirror, despite the virus still being around. Thank goodness quarantine rules are being dropped for double-jabbed travellers from the EU and U.S. Covid appears to be ebbing away, at any rate in this country. This creates a problem, as well as an opportunity, for Boris Johnson. Whether he likes it or not, we are at last going to see what he is really made of. STEPHEN GLOVER: The pandemic has consumed most of the Prime Minister’s energy and time, and nearly took his life He is well aware of this, of course. A couple of weeks ago he delivered what was billed as a keynote speech. The subject was ‘levelling up’. If you didn’t know what this meant when he began to speak, you were probably none the wiser after he had finished. There were the usual jokes and rhetorical flourishes. The PM said strong leadership was ‘the yeast that lifts the whole mattress of dough, the magic sauce, the ketchup of catch-up’. He would like to see more local mayors, but was a bit worried about the ‘loony Left’ taking charge. The joke about ketchup is funny, though not excessively so, and one wonders whether his editor might have advised him to take it out if he had included it in one of his Telegraph columns. It doesn’t mean anything. RELATED ARTICLES Share this article Two days ago, Mr Johnson set out a second stall in order to show that the Government has other robust ideas for a post-Covid country. It is his ‘Beating Crime Plan’, which is, in principle, thoroughly laudable. Sometimes almost woke-ish, Boris on this occasion channelled his inner Genghis Khan. He promised to force offenders to work in ‘fluorescent-jacketed chain gangs’ to deter people from antisocial behaviour. I personally would have no qualms if recidivist burglars, scammers (if ever apprehended) and inveterate muggers were subjected to such treatment, but we all know that it is never going to happen. To paraphrase a Boris Johnson column from years ago, I will eat my hat garnished with bacon if I ever see a chain gang of criminals in fluorescent overalls sweeping the streets or clearing the drains. STEPHEN GLOVER: Now, though, even the normally grim ‘Professor Lockdown’ — aka Neil Ferguson (pictured) — suggests that by October we may be looking back at the pandemic through our rear-view mirror It’s crowd-pleasing stuff. Not that I am against sometimes pleasing the crowd. But it is infinitely easier to crack a joke or conjure an image than it is to go through the grind of introducing new policies that make a discernible difference. In the case of burglary and petty crimes, offenders won’t be deterred so long as they know the police haven’t the faintest intention of arresting them, far less charging them. A revolution in the thinking of senior police officers is needed — and that is a mighty task. To return to ‘levelling up’, a few more local mayors are unlikely to make much difference. If economically depressed areas are going to recover, they will need higher productivity, better training, more investment and, I would argue, lower taxes. Are they going to receive any of those things? The fact is that this Government, having hardly covered itself in glory during the pandemic, faces more daunting challenges that any of its recent predecessors. Is it up to them? STEPHEN GLOVER: I doubt Priti Patel has the intellectual acumen to thrive at the Home Office and suspect her talents would be better employed in another job, such as party chairman Social care, rising crime, an overstretched NHS, housing shortages, illegal immigration, squabbles with the EU, threats from Russia and China . . . the list is very long. And it’s likely that when — or if — the Government grapples with these problems, it will do so against a background of rising inflation and a growing number of debilitating strikes in the public sector, where the wages of many workers are in real terms significantly less than they were ten years ago. If one were able to bring back a post-war prime minister from the dead to cope with the many crises we face, I would probably choose Clement Attlee or Margaret Thatcher. Of course, the two of them differed greatly politically. But both were characterised by principle, determination, attention to detail and ceaseless hard work. Can the more easygoing and less focused Boris Johnson rise to the test? It is one thing to dash about cracking jokes and producing colourful phrases. It is a far, far more difficult thing to govern. Moreover, Attlee and Thatcher were each surrounded by a number of highly competent Cabinet ministers, although in her first term Thatcher was undermined by the so-called wets. Boris, by contrast, is hardly blessed with first-rate lieutenants. A clearout of over-promoted and ineffectual ministers is overdue. I doubt Priti Patel has the intellectual acumen to thrive at the Home Office and suspect her talents would be better employed in another job, such as party chairman. The questions are: can Boris steel himself to wield the axe in the right places? And are there enough high-quality middle-ranking ministers to step into the shoes of those who should be sacked? There are numerous reasons for worrying about the next few years, though I don’t doubt the economy will bounce back in the short term. But Boris does at least have one thing in his favour. He is a highly ambitious man who cares deeply about his legacy. He has read some history and must know that posterity will not be especially interested in jokes or vivid turns of phrase. He will be judged by his achievements. If, for example, he can summon the courage to grip the issue of social care and find a just way of raising the estimated £10 billion needed to fund a decent scheme, he will be rightly celebrated by future generations. However, raising more National Insurance from those in work to pay for social care — but not from the over-65s who are closer to needing it — would almost certainly be divisive and widely unpopular. With careful and energetic planning, ‘Johnsonism’ could be remembered not as a set of off-the-cuff and purely pragmatic responses, but as a coherent collection of policies. Even ‘levelling up’ might make sense if clever people in Whitehall took the trouble to think about it. After the national trauma of Covid, people’s hopes and expectations are very high. Particularly in deprived former Labour ‘Red Wall’ seats in the North and the Midlands, many yearn for an honest politician who finally does what he promises. Words and jokes can amuse and divert, but in the end they aren’t enough. As Covid recedes, a new era begins. There will be a horrendous backlash if Boris Johnson fails to deliver.

 Still Panicking             Still Panicking           John Tierney joins Brian Anderson to discuss “The Panic Pandemic,” his feature in the Summer 2021 issue of City Journal on the costs of the Covid-19 lockdowns.  Audio Transcript Brian Anderson: Welcome back to the 10 Blocks Podcast. This is Brian Anderson, the editor of City Journal. Joining me on the show today is John Tierney. He's a contributing editor of City Journal and the author of the ""Panic Pandemic"", the lead story in this summer's print edition of our quarterly magazine. John, thanks as always for joining us. John Tierney: Thanks for inviting me, Brian. Brian Anderson: This is a terrific story, and I'd like to dive into it right away. You assert at the beginning of the essay that the American response to COVID-19, which you acknowledge has killed a lot of Americans—about one in 500, has in fact been more harmful than the virus itself. That's a striking claim. It's generated a lot of attention online, this piece. But let's look at the evidence for your argument. What was the nature, in your view of the pandemic response in the US and what costs more specifically, in your view, has it imposed on the country? John Tierney: Well, I think there's a good chance that in the long run it is going to prove deadlier than the coronavirus. I did an earlier piece for City Journal, ""Death and Lockdowns,"" where I looked into the excess deaths last year. And a good percentage of them, in fact, by some more recent estimates, 40 percent of the excess deaths among people under 65, of the deaths more than normal, were not due to COVID but rather the effects of the lockdown. The missed cancer screenings, the heart attacks that weren't treated, the fatal drug overdoses, there were more fatal car accidents. So there were lots of immediately deadly effects of the lockdowns and those effects are going to continue for years and years. I've written about this, Scott Atlas has published some work, and some other economists have, too, that when you cause such an enormous economic loss to people, that manifests itself later, in lower life expectancy. When students lose that much education, their life expectancy goes down. So there have been calculations that in the long run, the lockdowns will cause more years of life to be lost than the virus did. But beyond that is just the incredible social harm that was done. Children losing a year of school, a year of childhood, in a way; they didn't get to play with other children. The people who didn't see their grandparents, there was worsening of cases of Alzheimer's and dementia because isolation really contributes to that, it makes people more prone to die from that. And there was just the whole social disruption of so many people being put out of work. One in three people worldwide lost a job or a business during the lockdowns and half saw their earnings drop. And the World Bank estimates that more than a hundred million people have been pushed into extreme poverty. And we saw in the United States very bad effects of the lockdowns, the businesses that went under, the lives that were disrupted, the surging levels of anxiety and depression among people. But the worst consequences in many ways were felt in poor countries overseas because those people are more vulnerable, they're more susceptible to economic downturns and the lockdowns that the industrialized world did. And in many ways, the United States was the leader in creating and pushing these lockdowns on the rest of the world that just wreaked enormous havoc with people's lives and I think did far more damaged than the coronavirus did. And what makes it even more tragic is that we still don't have any evidence that the lockdowns actually saved any lives. Brian Anderson: Right. It's interesting to think back to where the world was back in March 2020, when the lockdowns were first imposed. China shut an entire city down and indeed after that much of the country when the outbreak was underway in Wuhan. Italy's healthcare system was overwhelmed, the exact properties of COVID-19 including its level of lethality were then unknown. Suddenly case counts were rising here at home, though we had neither the tests to know by how much, nor any kind of real plan or coherent plan to avoid mass casualties. So there was much we didn't know back then, when the lockdowns were first put in place. But the information we've learned since has in some ways cut in both directions. On the one hand, the disease caused by the virus really can kill people, especially those with immunocompromised systems or for the very elderly. But on the other hand, there's not much evidence, as you just suggested, that the lockdowns have had any positive effect whatsoever. So if you could go back in time to March 2020, knowing what you know now, what would be your message for the leaders of the world and citizens in various countries? What information would you tell them in an effort to minimize pandemic deaths and preserve basic freedoms? John Tierney: The first message would be that classic principle 'first do no harm.' Before you engage in this really risky and unprecedented experiment of shutting down society, you should really think about it, ask what evidence there is for it, and very carefully monitor the effects to see what it's doing. I can understand why, when we saw those images from Italy, when no one really knew much about the virus, it did make a certain amount of sense to say 15 days to slow the spread because there was this fear that hospitals were just about to be overwhelmed. We saw those images in Italy and in New York City. But in March and April of last year, and I wrote about this in City Journal, it was clear that infections in New York City, which is of course one of the hardest hit spots in the world and was mishandled in so many ways, but infections here peaked before Governor Cuomo announced a lockdown, and people could see that in April. I mean, it was a deadly virus, but pandemics do run in these cycles. And that had already started before the lockdown and yet it was just continued for the rest of the year. We kept locking things down. So I think the leaders also have to recognize one of the biggest mistakes that they made, like Cuomo said, 'I'm doing whatever the scientists tell me.' And that became the mantra, follow the science. But specialists in one scientific discipline, someone who knows a lot about infectious diseases, does not have the expertise to determine the best social policy. There are so many other considerations beyond simply stopping the spread of a virus. They have a very narrow focus. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx in the White House, their job was to stop the spread of the disease. They were being judged at the daily press conferences by what's the latest death toll, what's the latest case count. And they had a very limited perspective on the overall public health problem. And public health officials are supposed to not obsess about one disease, they're supposed to look at the larger consequences. And yet, that really was never done. There was no cost-benefit analysis. There were a few people like Scott Atlas and the Great Barrington scientists from Harvard, Oxford, and Stanford who were pointing these things out and just doing estimates, showing look, you're going to end up killing a lot of people with these lockdowns. But it became taboo to question them, and this narrative set in that lockdowns where the consensus, this untested strategy that was not recommended before COVID. In the CDC's planning scenarios, they envisioned certain steps for certain kinds of epidemics, and for the most extreme pandemic in their planning scenario, one as bad as the Spanish Flu of 1918, which was killing young people and children, they did not envision extended school closures, they did not call for shutting down businesses. This was a totally novel strategy that was just adopted and suddenly, once it happened, it just became this policy that couldn't be changed. I mean, I guess one thing we really did learn was that once you lockdown, it's very hard to open up. Because once you start making this idea that we're going to beat this virus, we're going to get to zero COVID, we're going to stop it, then you can never open up again because a new virus causes a lot of devastation, then it becomes endemic, it doesn't go away. The flu doesn't go away, we learned to live with it, and there are years where we have more than 100,000 people die from the flu, but we don't shut down society for that. And we really did learn that once you shut down and once you instill so much fear in people, so much irrational fear and you exaggerate the danger of it, it's very hard to open back up again. Brian Anderson: Yeah. Walking this back becomes extremely difficult. You mention in your essay, Florida as a state that generally resisted mass lockdowns and yet did pretty well when compared with other American states, when you're looking at COVID deaths, cases, and keeping the health care system functioning. What about some of the countries that have offered similar examples? Sweden, for example. John Tierney: Right. Sweden was criticized early on because it was doing worse than its neighbors Finland and Norway. Although it wasn't doing worse than the UK and other countries. There were some reasons why Sweden did worse than its neighbors Finland and Norway. But what people have missed in that argument is that, over the long haul, Sweden has done a little better than the European average on COVID mortality. And Finland and Norway have done better than Sweden, but they have followed policies like Sweden's for most of the pandemic, they locked down more last spring and they closed their borders earlier, which might've been a good move. But aside from that, those three countries have not had mass mandates, they're among the only countries in Europe that don't mandate masks. They kept their schools open without masks, without social distancing. And they have done significantly better, each of them, than the rest of Europe when it comes to preventing excess deaths. In other words their levels of mortality compared to a normal year are significantly better than most countries in Europe. So, my argument is that lockdowns are a medical treatment, and no medical treatment or drug would be approved if it's not proven to do better than the control group. And effectively Florida was the control group in this experiment in the United States. They locked down briefly early, but then opened up while most of the rest of the country was locking down, and they did better. Their age-adjusted rate for COVID mortality was better than all but 10 other states. And if the control group is doing better, if the treatment group is dying off faster than the control group you should stop the experiment. I mean, you would do that in a clinical trial. And we had the same thing in Europe where Finland, Norway, and Sweden were just about the least restrictive countries in Europe, and they did significantly better than the rest of Europe. So I mean, that to me is the strongest evidence. There have been a lot of studies of trying to gauge the effects of lockdown. And early on, there were some studies where they did these mathematical models projecting if we hadn't locked down, this would have happened. And these studies purported to find that lockdown save lives. But these were very hypothetical situations and a lot of the assumptions were quite dubious, in fact, they were severely criticized. Meanwhile, there've been lots of other studies comparing one comparable country with another, one county with another that didn't lockdown, one state with another. And you generally see that the places that locked down did no better and often they did much worse than places that did not lockdown. So, given all that evidence, I mean, no drug with this sort of track record, no medical treatment would ever be approved if there was no evidence that it worked. This is really the most dangerous experiment ever conducted and there are still people that want to continue doing it, despite the lack of evidence that the lockdowns did any good. Brian Anderson: Well that really leads to the next question I had, which is, we're 16 months on in the pandemic, we've now got multiple vaccines that work, that seem to minimize the chances of severe illness and death from COVID, and in many cases even infection. They've been widely available for months, yet many public health authorities, especially in cities are still clamoring for restrictions. LA just reimposed an indoor mask mandate, for example. So what explains the shift from lockdowns as a kind of short-term prudential measure to lockdowns as basically a new form of life, a permanent form of life? John Tierney: Well, I think that there are two causes for the panic that has happened. One is simply that there is this, I mean, I call it the crisis crisis, this perpetual state of alarm that is fomented by journalists and by their favorite doomsayers and other assorted experts. Journalists always exaggerate crises, many of the crises are really non-existent. And I think that's something else that I would have told politicians back in March of 2020, do not make policy based on worst-case scenarios. Over and over again, as I pointed out in the piece, experts have exaggerated the dangers of epidemics. They have their own narrow focus and they do not want to risk under predicting, both because it looks bad if something does happen that they didn't warn about, they basically covered themselves by giving some huge number and then they can claim well, we managed to avert that. They have a built-in incentive for what I call the crisis industry. Journalists have a built-in incentive to scare people. They find the most pessimistic doomsayers to quote because it makes for better copy, it attracts more attention. And these doomsayers have their own motives for wanting to exaggerate a crisis. If you're a specialist in epidemiology, exaggerating the danger of this crisis you suddenly get publicity, you get prestige, more funding is going to flow to you. The bigger the problem seems, the more money and more power you get for that. And I think to some extent, public health officials, they're human and it's become this kind of new obsession to focus on this one disease. And as people have said, they've kept moving the goalpost. At first, it was we just wanted to slow the spread; now it's zero COVID. And I mean, it makes no sense to me that, with so much of the population vaccinated, with everybody who's at risk having had an opportunity to get a vaccine, why we should be locking down, why children should be wearing masks—the children never needed to wear a mask—and why we should be doing this. It's kind of the crisis industry trying to keep this thing going, because it's gotten them audiences, it's gotten them a lot of attention and I think they hate to see the crisis ending. Brian Anderson: Well, you mentioned two reasons for this panic. The other in your essay is a very important theme of your work, which is the politicization of scientific research. And that has manifested itself during the pandemic in outright censorship of scientific debate. I wonder if you could say a little bit about that and what we can conceivably do about it. John Tierney: I've called it the Left's war on science, and it's not new to COVID. Back in the 1920s, Progressives dreamed of a world with experts, social engineers, directing society and using their great scientific knowledge and expertise, giving them great powers to do this, and to do so without being accountable to voters or public opinion. And that has long been a dream of the Left, that we need to follow the science, which really means giving powers to the public officials and leaders to impose policies on people, using science as a justification. And, as the Left has come to dominate more and more institutions—universities, scientific journals, scientific associations—they've become political monocultures. In any kind of monoculture, people become susceptible to group think and they also start silencing heretics instead of encouraging the kind of debate that science has. They start thinking that their opinions are not only the norm, but also truth. We've seen this before COVID, we've seen that people who did research, whose findings challenged Progressive orthodoxy on things like IQ, on race, on family structure, on environmental issues like climate change, that the scientists who've done that, many of them very good scientists, have been demonized, their work has been censored. There've been efforts to cut off any funding to them, even if it comes from private sources. So this has been going on for decades. Some of the early IQ researchers had to have armed guards when they went to give speeches, because there was so much hostility. And we've seen this growing intolerance, this growing desire to shut down debate on a challenge to Leftist orthodoxy on the scientific issues. But then COVID came along and it was really a perfect storm. Jane Fonda called it God's gift to the Left because, by exaggerating the danger of the virus, there were short-term political benefits because it hurt Donald Trump's election chances and tanking the economy also hurt him too, his chances. So you had that immediate political payoff from playing up the pandemic and shutting down the economy, but you also had this just amazing opportunity to suddenly give scientists, these high priests, these expert social engineers, these vast new powers to shape society. And at the start of the pandemic when China did it, I mean, one could imagine how an authoritarian society like China can do this. It is centrally managed. And Dr. Fauci said he couldn't imagine locking down American cities, Americans won't stand for that. But he was wrong. The crisis industry was so effective in scaring people that people willingly surrendered. There were majorities of people in the opinion polls who were in favor of this, and they gave up their right to work, to study, to go out to eat, to even leave their homes, to go to church. It was shocking to me to see how readily people gave up these liberties, and I think for the left there were progressive celebrating this and saying, boy, this is a great paradigm shift. We're away from this obsession with individual liberties, we now have to all make sacrifices for the common good when led by the science, the Left's version of the science. And they started calling this a blueprint for how to deal with climate change and other environmental issues. I do fear that the lockdowns are a dress rehearsal for policies that will greatly curtail people's liberties in the name of climate change. Brian Anderson: It's very troubling. You had a little bit of this, City Journal had a little bit of this experience with the piece you did on the pandemic a while back with some Facebook intervention. Perhaps you want to describe that a little bit to inform readers about it. John Tierney: Yes. I wrote about this in some earlier articles, this whole issue of shutting down scientific debate. It's been going on for a while, but I'm shocked by how much it has escalated in the last few years, and particularly during this pandemic. Early on, nobody knew how lethal the virus was, and some researchers at Stanford did one of the first good studies trying to gauge how many people were infected and how many of them were dying. And they just faced this enormous outcry. And what they found was that the fatality rate was considerably lower than what the computer models were using, what the media was screaming about. And they were denounced for endangering lives, for being unethical. Stanford University, subjected them to this fact-finding inquiry. There were calls that they should be even drummed out of professional societies. And to see this sort of suppression—these were prominent, very well-respected scientists who this happened to. And that really set the tone, where people became so afraid to question this lockdown narrative. Martin Kulldorff from Harvard, one of the world's leading experts on infectious diseases says that there's always a certain amount of herd thinking in science, but he's never seen it reached this level. He said that most of the experts he talked to, the other scientists, were against lockdowns, but they were afraid to speak up. In the article I write about how Scientific American published a welcome article trying to introduce some sanity to this by defending the Stanford researchers and saying we shouldn't politicize this research, we should try to really find out how dangerous this virus is before we take steps. And then Scientific American, there was all this online fury, and they basically just repudiated their own article. So the level of fear of deviating from this consensus was shocking. And it's antithetical, science is a process of discovery and debate; you have to have these debates. And yet it became taboo to question the narrative. It's a frightening precedent that was set. Brian Anderson: And I guess the social media censorship is basically an outgrowth of this attitude. Right? John Tierney: Right. And I mean, they censored the article that I wrote, which quoted a German study that reported harms to children from wearing masks. They were taking reports from I think 20,000 parents who reported lots of harms to their children from wearing masks. And this was not at all surprising. There are dozens of studies that have shown that wearing masks causes a lot of problems. You get less oxygen, it's harder to concentrate, harder to learn. It interferes with socialization. There are lots of documented harms from it, but Facebook uses this fact-checking groups called Health Feedback and Science Feedback, and they labeled the study as being not supported. And my article was labeled on Facebook, partly false, simply because it accurately reported what this study found. And this was a study that was published in a peer-reviewed journal. There was nothing wrong with the study, but that was censored. And I was just one of many. These scientists who called for an alternative to lockdowns, this focus protection strategy in what was known as the Great Barrington Declaration, Google shadow banned their declaration so that you couldn't find it, all you'd find was criticism of it. Facebook shut down their page. Ron DeSantis, who, fortunately for the people of Florida, actually listened to these scientists, consulted with them. And they were amazed that whenever they mentioned a scientific study to them, he'd already read it and sort of knew the methodology of it. It was astonishing to hear that about a politician. But he sat down for a panel discussion with them and YouTube removed it because the scientists were saying they don't think children should be wearing masks. So basically Facebook was enforcing this narrative, and so was Google and YouTube. I think it's one of the reasons that these bans continue, of course, and kids are still wearing masks, because people have not heard about the harms of wearing masks and they haven't seen a balanced discussion of how little good they do.

You can also find guidance and support on the GOV.UK website. Search news You can use the filters to show only news items that match your interests News Chief midwife urges pregnant women to get NHS COVID jab England’s top midwife is urging expectant mums to get the COVID-19 vaccine after new data shows the overwhelming majority of pregnant women hospitalised with the virus have not had a jab. The new figures, released today, also reveal that no pregnant women with both doses of the vaccine had been admitted to hospital. Since May, just three women had been admitted after having their first vaccine. In contrast, almost all (98%) pregnant women admitted to hospital with COVID-19 had not been jabbed. Now Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, Chief Midwifery Officer for England, has written to fellow midwives and GP practices across the country stressing the need to encourage pregnant women to get the jab to protect them and their baby. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, Chief Midwifery Officer for England, said: “Vaccines save lives, and this is another stark reminder that the COVID-19 jab can keep you, your baby and your loved ones, safe and out of hospital. “Thanks to the planning, skill and dedication of hard-working staff the NHS COVID vaccination programme is the biggest in health service history and the most precise in Europe. But we need everyone to come forward and take up the evergreen offer of a jab which is why I am calling on pregnant women to take action to protect themselves and their babies and on my fellow midwives to ensure they have the information they need to do so.” Since April, pregnant women have been offered the jab in line with their age cohort, and health leaders are calling on more younger adults to come forward and close the uptake gap. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and the Royal College of Midwives have both recommended vaccination as one of the best defences for pregnant women against severe COVID-19 infection, while the independent JCVI confirms the jab has been shown to be effective and safe for women carrying a baby. Whilst broadly in line with the current rise in hospital admissions due to coronavirus, the new data, collated by the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS), shows the number of pregnant women being admitted to hospital with COVID-19 is increasing and many needing care are experiencing acute symptoms. In the last three months alone, one in three pregnant women in hospital with COVID-19 in England required additional respiratory support (33%), with more than a third developing pneumonia (37%), and around one in seven needing intensive care (15%). The data also shows that one in five women admitted to hospital with serious COVID symptoms went on to give birth prematurely, and the likelihood of delivery by caesarean section doubled. One in five babies born to mothers with COVID symptoms were also admitted to neonatal units. Dr Edward Morris, President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “Every day our members are seeing very sick pregnant women with COVID-19 in hospital and the majority are unvaccinated. We want to reassure pregnant women that COVID-19 vaccines are the safest and best way to protect you and your baby from severe illness and premature birth. One dose of COVID-19 vaccination gives good protection against infection, so the sooner you can book your first appointment the better. You can have your second dose eight weeks after your first, which will provide a good level of immunity against the Delta variant. We thank the Chief Midwife for her efforts to encourage pregnant women to get the jab.” Gill Walton, Chief Executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said: “Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect you and your baby against COVID-19. It really is that simple. Hundreds of thousands of pregnant women worldwide have been vaccinated, safely and effectively protecting themselves against COVID and dramatically reducing their risk of serious illness or harm to their baby. “It’s so important for pregnant women to get their jab, particularly with the virus being so prevalent and the Delta variant proving itself to be so much more transmissible. If you have questions, talk to your midwife, talk to your obstetrician, talk to your GP. Get the answers you need and get the jab.” Real-world data from the United States shows that more than 130,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated without any safety concerns being raised and more than 55,000 pregnant women in the UK have also received at least one dose of the vaccine. Based on this data, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised earlier this year that pregnant women should be offered the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Any pregnant women who have questions or concerns about the vaccine can speak to their GP, midwife or obstetrician to get more information and advice. Even if they have previously declined the vaccine, they can book an appointment to get their jab on the NHS National Booking Service website or call 119 between 7am and 11pm.","Fri, 30 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.england.nhs.uk/2021/07/chief-midwife-urges-pregnant-women-to-get-nhs-covid-jab/,NHS England » Chief midwife urges pregnant women to get NHS COVID jab - NHS England

            COVID: the beta variant is surging in mainland Europe – should the UK be worried?
          
 
      Lecturer, Biomedical Science, Birmingham City University
     Tara Hurst received funding from Neuroblastoma UK.   Birmingham City University provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list Most of the world, the UK included, is currently grappling with the delta variant of the coronavirus. But in parts of Europe there has also been a resurgence of an earlier variant of concern: beta (B1351). First discovered in South Africa, it has since dispersed globally, but hasn’t yet gained a good foothold in the UK.  The picture is different for France and Spain, however. On GISAID – a database that collates genetically sequenced COVID-19 samples from around the world – 14.2% of Spanish submissions and 1.9% of French submissions over the past four weeks have been beta variant samples. For Spain, the total number of recorded beta cases on the database has nearly doubled during this period. Across the rest of Europe there have been barely any cases, with only two new British beta samples being logged over the past month (Spain has logged 378). But the resurgence of this variant so close to British shores, in two countries that are popular holiday destinations for people from the UK, will be a concern for the government. Escape potential The particular worry with beta is that it might be able to get around people’s immunity – it has shown at least some ability to evade the effects of COVID-19 vaccines. But just how much of a threat is it? In one clinical trial, the variant was found to elude the protection provided by the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. This study looked at both the ability of two doses of the vaccine to prevent infection with the coronavirus and protect against mild-to-moderate COVID-19.  Among people who had and hadn’t had the vaccine, the development of mild-to-moderate symptoms was approximately the same: 3.2% of placebo recipients and 2.6% of vaccine recipients developed symptoms. This suggested that the vaccine offered only 10.4% protection against developing mild-to-moderate COVID-19 when facing the beta variant. And when testing the ability of the vaccinated participants’ antibodies to block viral infection, they found that this was significantly reduced or lost altogether for the beta variant compared to the original form of the coronavirus.   This is concerning – though the study also had its limits. There weren’t any cases of severe COVID-19 in either the vaccinated or control groups, and so no conclusions can be drawn about the AstraZeneca vaccine’s ability to protect against severe disease. It’s possible that it does offer such protection, but further research is needed.  Other vaccines have also performed less well against the beta variant, though not quite as starkly as this. A French study estimates that two doses of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine offers 77% protection against developing symptomatic COVID-19 when facing the beta variant, compared to 88% protection against the original form of the coronavirus, and 86% protection against the alpha variant. Data from Public Health England meanwhile estimates that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine also offer 88% protection against symptomatic COVID-19 when facing the delta variant. This suggests that beta is somewhat better at evading immunity than all of the variants that have so far caused major disease in the UK. But another vaccine – currently being developed by Novavax – looks like it could offer good protection against the beta variant too. According to the company, in lab experiments the blood serum of vaccinated people worked well at neutralising the beta variant. However, these results have yet to be externally reviewed, and they don’t confirm whether the vaccine will actually prevent beta from causing disease in people – only that the immunity generated works well against the virus.  The company also has an additional modified version of this vaccine engineered specifically to target beta, which could be even stronger against it. Thus, while beta seems to be able to escape immune protection offered by some current vaccines, future ones may be able to be given as booster shots to top up immunity where needed. A travelling threat Beta is prevalent in the southern African region, with 4.2% of GISAID submissions from South Africa and 6.1% from Botswana being beta samples over the past four weeks. However, the delta variant is now making inroads across this region and the wider continent. Over 50% of African GISAID submissions during the first half of the year were beta; now the figure is just 11%. Nearly 80% are currently delta.  What we are witnessing worldwide is the process of evolution. Forms of the coronavirus that are more able to take hold in a population are outcompeting others. Typically, it’s the delta variant that is gaining dominance: it’s estimated to be 97% more transmissible than the original form of the coronavirus, whereas in comparison alpha, beta and gamma are only 29%, 25% and 38% more transmissible than the original. However, it is entirely possible that multiple variants may co-exist, so it’s not a given that one variant (such as beta) will be completely outcompeted by another (such as delta). We don’t know how beta will fare in the long term. Ultimately, the UK should be worried about the presence of beta in France and Spain, though not merely because of the close proximity of these countries. The movement of variants from one country to another doesn’t depend on geographical closeness. If you view this transmission animation created by GISAID, you can see beta initially spread from South Africa to distant countries, including Greece and the US, rather than to other countries in Africa.  The main reason for the UK to be concerned is the current summer season, and the higher likelihood of UK nationals travelling to the continent compared to at other times. Spain and France are very popular with British holiday makers. This, rather than simple proximity, raises the risk of beta being imported into the UK. And if it does arrive and begin to spread, there’s some evidence that the vaccines we’ve used will be less effective at preventing it from causing disease.

2," UK Covid: 31,117 new cases as research suggests vaccines have prevented 60,000 deaths in England – as it happened This live blog is now closed. For coronavirus updates from around the world, please follow our global Covid blog  Live feed Afternoon summary That’s all from me for today. But our coronavirus coverage continues on our global live blog. It’s here. Sunak defends plan to end £20 per week universal credit uplift Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has defended the decision to end the £20 per week uplift to universal credit at the end of September. But that would not mean the government was no longer committed to helping people, he said. The increase was introduced as a temporary measure at the start of the pandemic. Ministers have been under pressure to make it permanent, but Sunak said it would end. Speaking on a visit to Scotland, he said: That was always meant to be a temporary intervention, that was clear from the outset. Like furlough and the other things we’ve done, some will start to ease off. But we’re not done helping people get through this. Asked about families who could find themselves in poverty when the uplift ends, he replied: There’s lots of different ways we can help those people. What we’re doing is providing support in a way that will sustainably help those people. I think the right thing is to help those families into really high-paid work, that’s the best way to help those children. We know that children growing up in a workless household are five times more likely to be in poverty than those that don’t. That tells me that the best way to help those children is to help their parents find really good jobs. Boris Johnson is also fond of saying he favours work as an alternative to benefits as a route out of poverty. But, as a recent Institute for Fiscal Studies report points out, excluding pensioners, only a third of low-income people live in a workless household. Lib Dems accuse government of introducing 'Covid ID cards by stealth' after change to app settings The government has been accused of introducing “Covid ID cards by stealth” after it emerged that the NHS app, which has been showing people’s vaccination status for overseas travel, now includes a “domestic” section for use at venues asking to see a Covid pass. Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dems’ home affairs spokesman, said: The government has just committed to vaccine passports by stealth. This deceitful move is deeply shameful. We now have a new ID card snuck onto our phones without even as much as a whisper from the government. Just this morning, ministers on TV and radio were flapping about when asked simple questions how this would actually work. Now it is on all our phones. To get your vaccine passport, you have to type and click through a bunch of options. Just think of the faff getting into hospitality businesses, who don’t want it and can’t afford to pay staff to police it. The Conservatives are no strangers to a U-turn, they should have no problem with doing the right thing and scrapping vaccine passports for good.  “At least when Tony Blair tried to introduce ID cards he put a bill to parliament. This lot won’t even open up parliament to debate it. They must recall parliament now if they are serious about this.” New Covid cases rise for second day in row - although weekly trend still shows them going down New Covid cases have risen for the second day in a row, according to the latest update to the government’s dashboard. They have gone up from 27,734 yesterday to 31,117 today - a rise of 3,383, following yesterday’s rise of 4,223.  But the new total is still well below the equivalent figure for a week ago today (39,906). And the total number of new cases over the past week is still 37.1% down on the total for the previous seven days. The dashboard also shows that there have been 85 further deaths. Total deaths over the past week are up 28.9% on the total for the previous seven days. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution says it received around £200,000 in donations in a 24-hour period this week as it defended the work it has done rescuing migrants in difficulty crossing the Channel, following criticism from the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. Normally it gets around £7,000 a day. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has been among those contributing. (See 1.10pm.) Demand for flights from the US to the UK has surged since the government announced the scrapping of the quarantine requirement for fully vaccinated travellers, PA Media reports. Virgin Atlantic said it received more than three times as many bookings for flights from New York to London compared with a week earlier, while total bookings across all its US to UK routes more than doubled. Public Health England has published its weekly Covid surveillance report (pdf). It covers the week ending Sunday 25 July and it says during that period “case rates decreased in most age groups, and in all regions and ethnic groups”. This week's #COVID19 surveillance report shows case rates continue to be highest in those aged 10-19 years old.Read the full report here: https://t.co/FCcjHmBd7v pic.twitter.com/5e7xcHXDlt Our weekly #COVID19 surveillance report also shows that case rates continue to be highest in the North East.Find out more here: https://t.co/FCcjHmBd7v pic.twitter.com/DQPvCyaHDa “Herd immunity [from coronavirus] may be in sight,” a prominent thinktank has claimed. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research produces a fortnightly Covid tracker, and in its latest edition, out today, it says the latest peak in cases “has occurred somewhat sooner than we forecast”.  Under the headline “herd immunity may be in sight”, it forecasts “a uniform reduction of cases across all English regions”. It says: It would appear that a large enough proportion of the population is currently immune, due either to vaccination or prior infection, thereby reducing the probability of transmission between persons. Vaccines have prevented 60,000 deaths and 22m Covid cases in England, research suggests Prof Jonathan Van-Tam the deputy chief medical officer for England told BBC News a few minutes ago that new research suggested that vaccines had prevented 22m coronavirus infections and 60,000 deaths in England. He was speaking shortly before the publication of Public Health England’s latest vaccine surveillance report (pdf), which contains the figures. It says: Estimates suggest that 60,000 deaths and 22,057,000 infections have been prevented as a result of the Covid-19 vaccination programme, up to 9 July. This calculation is based on how many people would have been infected, or died, without the vaccines, assuming no other interventions. But of course if the vaccines were not available, then it is almost certain that much tougher lockdown measures would have remained in force. The recent fall in Covid cases as measured by the government’s Covid dashboard does not look plausible, a prominent academic has said. Prof Tim Spector said he thought the official data looks “a bit fishy” because it does not correspond with what other figures are showing. Spector runs the Zoe Covid Symptom Study, which uses an app to get people to report when they are suffering coronavirus symptoms. More than 4 million people around the world have downloaded it, and its data has provided a broadly reliable guide to how the pandemic has developed over the last year. As Sky News reports, his figures suggest cases are running at about twice the level recorded on the government’s dashboard. Spector said he thought the fall in the number of cases recorded on the dashboard over the past week looked “very suspicious”. He explained: It’s dropped something like 30% in two days, which is pretty much unheard of in pandemics, and remember this is happening without restrictions, without lockdowns, without some sudden event. To me, it looks a bit fishy. It looks as if there’s some other explanation for this other than suddenly the virus has given up. Spector said one explanation might be younger people choosing not to get tested. No 10 says 260 of promised 2,000 workplace testing centres for workers exempt from isolation rules now open Here are the main points from the Downing Street lobby briefing. The chancellor has said previously that the triple lock is government policy. But we recognise people’s concerns. We’ve got to ensure fairness for both taxpayers and pensioners. The spokesman said the government was keeping the figures under review. When it was put to him that the whole point of the triple lock was to ensure that annual pension increases are no longer subject to review, the spokesman just referred journalists back to what the chancellor has said on this previously.

4," NHS Covid-19 app pings rise by over 70,000 to new record The number of self-isolation alerts sent by the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales has risen to a new record of 689,313 in the week up to 21 July.  The figures represent an increase of over 70,000 compared with the previous week. But the rate of increase was lower than the previous week, rising by 11% compared to 17%. If you are ""pinged"" by the app you are advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. However the government has said it is crucial for people to do so. In recent weeks, there has been widespread criticism that the app has been sending out so many alerts that hundreds of thousands of people are self-isolating and missing work, causing widespread disruption. It led to the government allowing some key workers - such as those working in food distribution - to be exempt from having to self-isolate if pinged. Instead they have to take daily tests. There are currently 260 testing sites open for these workers, Downing Street said on Thursday - and they are working to set up another 800. After that, 1,200 more sites will be opened ""over the coming days"". From 16 August, all fully-vaccinated people will not need to self-isolate if pinged by the app, although they will be encouraged to book a Covid PCR test. The impact on businesses has resulted in calls for the 16 August deadline to be brought forward. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is asking for urgent assistance to exempt staff pinged by the NHS Covid app saying pings are affecting production. Many in the hospitality industry also complained of shortages as staff had to self-isolate. Some bar staff have told the BBC that they've lost a lot of money by missing shifts, while others say they have been told to delete the app by their manager. The app alert is advisory only and not enforceable by law, unlike a phone call from the NHS Test and Trace team. Latest data from Test and Trace shows that 14% of cases transferred to contact-tracers in the week to 21 July were not reached and so were unable to provide details of close contacts.  This is the highest proportion of people not reached since October last year. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van Tam said separate figures from Public Health England showed the vaccines have now prevented 22 million Covid cases and 60,000 deaths. He added it was ""truly massive"". If you were looking for evidence that the ""pingdemic"" is over you will struggle to find it in these statistics. The figure of nearly 690,000 contact tracing alerts - or pings - is a new record, up 11% on the previous week. They were triggered by nearly 148,000 positive test results entered in the app, up 25%. Despite the anecdotal evidence of people switching off or getting rid of the app, there is no sign yet of mass deletions. But there are a few straws in the wind suggesting things might be changing. The rate of increase in pings slowed, and the number of alerts triggered by each positive test result was down. That suggests that people who later became infected had fewer close contacts - either because they were socialising less or because those they encountered did not have the app. In the week when restrictions in England were relaxed so that venues did not need to record visitors' details, check-ins via the app were sharply lower. As they find they don't need it to check in, more people may decide the app is more trouble than it's worth. But the team which designed it believes the NHS Covid-19 app is changing behaviour in useful ways - even if someone ignores a ping's instruction to self isolate they may become more cautious, and anyone who has a holiday planned may be nudged into staying at home for a few days beforehand rather than having their plans spoiled by an alert. At first, it was criticised for being ineffective, in recent weeks it's been accused of disrupting thousands of businesses, but its designers believe this experimental technology is finally proving that it can be a useful weapon in controlling the pandemic. After a week of falling cases the number of people testing positive for coronavirus rose on Wednesday, when 27,734 new daily cases were reported. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""The truth is, when it comes to case numbers no one really knows where they are going to go next"". How does the NHS Covid app work? People in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own). If you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid-19 and share the information with the app. The app uses the Bluetooth signal to determine whether your phone had recently been within 2m of theirs for at least 15 minutes. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for up to 10 days. Separately to the NHS Covid app, there have also been changes to the NHS app, which among other things is used for Covid vaccination records. It has been updated to allow iPhone and iPad users to store their Covid Pass using the Apple Wallet app. This can be used at events and venues in England, but not for international travel the government says.

5," NICE publishes new rapid guideline to diagnose and treat rare blood clotting condition associated with COVID-19 vaccination NICE has today (29 July 2021) published a new rapid COVID-19 guideline to help healthcare staff identify and treat patients who develop the rare syndrome vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) after receiving COVID-19 vaccinations.  29 July 2021  Thrombocytopenia is a condition where a person has a low platelet count, while thrombosis is the formation of blood clots. Although extremely rare, with only 14.2 cases occurring per million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, this condition can be very serious and requires swift diagnosis and urgent treatment. This new guideline outlines how to identify people with suspected VITT, and what tests should be carried out to confirm they have VITT. The recommendations also cover treatment options for people with VITT depending on how serious their syndrome is and how their symptoms react to treatment. The guideline recommends that healthcare staff refer people with suspected VITT who are acutely unwell to the emergency department immediately. If the person is not acutely unwell and results can be obtained and reviewed on the same day, then a full blood count should be performed in primary care. If these blood tests show a low platelet count then the person should then be referred to the emergency department on the same day. If blood tests indicate the person is unlikely to have VITT, then healthcare staff should discuss the signs and symptoms of VITT with them and provide advice on when and where to seek further medical attention if their symptoms persist or worsen. If a high clinical suspicion of VITT remain then they should consider repeating the full blood count after two to three days if symptoms worsen, or discuss further tests with a clinical haematologist. VITT is confirmed using a test called an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), that detects a certain antibody that people with VITT have called platelet factor 4 (PF4). However, if healthcare staff suspect that a patient has VITT they should start treatment in consultation with a haematologist without waiting for ELISA results. If the person has developed thrombosis, healthcare staff should perform same-day imaging tests such as a CT scan to confirm where the blood clot is before starting treatment. Dr Paul Chrisp, director of NICE’s Centre for Guidelines, said: “Although VITT is a very rare condition, it’s crucial that healthcare professionals feel supported and able to swiftly identify and treat the small number of people who do develop it. “This is a living guideline, which can be continuously updated to incorporate the latest evidence and keep abreast of new developments. “This guideline has not looked at the safety of COVID-19 vaccines; that is not NICE’s remit and the data from the MHRA shows the benefits of COVID vaccines far outweigh the risks. NICE’s role here is to provide the best advice to help clinicians treat patients in the rare instances where they do develop VITT.” The guideline recommends treatment options for people with VITT, including non-heparin anticoagulation drugs and surgical interventions to treat thrombosis. Patients should also initially receive intravenous immunoglobulin to treat the VITT immune response. The guideline recommends that a haematologist should be involved in decisions around starting or stopping treatments. When discharged from hospital, patients should continue to be monitored by the haematology department and advised what to do if their symptoms worsen.    As with the managing COVID-19 guideline, the VITT guideline has been developed and published in the MAGICapp platform, a global system that promotes evidence sharing from different guideline creators, therefore increasing the speed at which recommendations can be developed and the ease with which they can be updated. The guideline can be read here.   Although VITT is a very rare condition, it’s crucial that healthcare professionals feel supported and able to swiftly identify and treat the small number of people who do develop it.","Thu, 29 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.nice.org.uk/news/article/nice-publishes-new-rapid-guideline-to-diagnose-and-treat-rare-blood-clotting-condition-associated-with-covid-19-vaccination,NICE publishes new rapid guideline to diagnose and treat rare blood clotting condition associated with COVID-19 vaccination - NICE
6," UK Covid cases rise for second day running amid drop in testing Experts warn against drawing conclusions from fluctuations as 31,117 daily infections reported The daily number of Covid cases reported in the UK has risen for the second day in a row, although experts have cautioned against drawing premature conclusions from the fluctuations. On Thursday, 31,117 cases were reported in the UK, up from 27,734 the day before, which marked the first rise in cases since 20 July.  While the recent drop in cases has been much discussed, according to Dr Claire Bayntun, vice-president of the RSM and clinical consultant in global public health, there has also been a recent drop in testing. Speaking at an online seminar hosted by the society, she said: “I’ve just come from a meeting with colleagues at PHE [Public Health England], and in fact they were just confirming there’s been a 20% reduction in testing over this very recent period,” she said – although it was unclear whether this related to the UK or England alone. Bayntun added that PHE believed “there was very clear uptick [in] rate, resulting in the peak following the Euros, which again was expected”, noting that while at present there was a rise in hospital admissions and mortality, the situation may, potentially, have improved.  The reduction in testing chimes with data from the government coronavirus dashboard that reveals the total number of tests conducted in the UK fell by just over 14% for 22 July to 28 July, compared with the previous seven days (15 to 21 July). While the latest flu and Covid surveillance report from PHE suggests there may have been a slight decline in the prevalence of the virus, Hugh Montgomery, a professor of intensive care medicine at University College London, who also took part in the RSM seminar, suggested the decline in testing may not only be down to fewer infections. “Of course part of that might be because there are 20% fewer people with any symptoms that want testing, but most of our evidence would say that people are avoiding testing so numbers may be higher than they are,” he said, although he noted that it did seem as if cases had recently fallen to some extent. Earlier in the meeting, Montgomery said of such avoidance: “Increasingly, it appears that lots of people don’t want to be tested or swabbed partly because it might stop them going on holiday, etc.”  While Montgomery said the current data was not “desperately reliable”, particularly on cases, he added that at present there were about 25,000 to 27,000 cases a day in the UK, with approximately 850 admissions a day and above 90 deaths. Allowing for a time lag between diagnosis and admission, about 2% of cases were currently admitted to hospital, he added. Montgomery also raised concerns about the uptake of Covid jabs, saying the latest PHE figures showed current vaccination rates were “woefully low”. According to the latest report by PHE, vaccine uptake for first doses in England appears to have largely levelled off in all age groups. At present, 95.5% of those aged 75-79 have received at least one dose, compared with 59.9% among those aged 25-29. “When I talked to friends of mine who work in vaccination centres, I spoke to one who said that she was there on Monday and they had 92 booked slots and they had eight people turn up,” he said, adding that some people had decided Covid was no longer a problem, while others believed in the conspiracy theory that the vaccines contain microchips. Montgomery said new mutations would occur and noted that many scientists were concerned about lifting restrictions while many people are still not yet fully vaccinated. More than one in 10 adults in the UK have yet to receive their first dose of a Covid jab and the vast majority of under-18s have not been vaccinated. “We are indeed I think running that risk of letting it run wild,” he said.  Montgomery, 58, said he did not believe life would return to normal in his lifetime and that people would remain cautious, adding that mask wearing should continue while hopefully people will try to live more of their lives outside. Unless the virus mutates into something akin to the common cold, he said, “I can’t see the occasion when I’m going to want to be crammed into the pub shouting at the rugger in the autumn internationals or the Six Nations in the way that I used to, and that’s a shame, because I used to very much enjoy a pint in my hand and shouting at the television set, but I won’t be doing that.” Dr Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, who did not attend the meeting, said current datasets were “chaotic” and reflected the confluence of many different factors at the same time. “Likely a combination of school summer holidays, hot weather, and the lifting of restrictions,” he said. “Hopes have been pinned on the overall trend heading downwards, but a few days’ infection numbers here or there are in no way a reliable way to predict what the future holds.”  Most popular Most popular","Thu, 29 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/29/uk-covid-cases-rise-second-day-running-amid-drop-testing,UK Covid cases rise for second day running amid drop in testing - The Guardian

8," Covid: University students could be told jabs are required - Raab By Francesca GillettBBC News University students will get ""advance warning"" if they are required to have vaccines before moving to halls of residence, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary said decisions will be taken in September - but he was keen to encourage vaccine uptake. More than 70% of adults have now had both jabs, and Mr Raab said ""we need to close that margin"". Currently, the government plans to require two jabs to go to nightclubs and other crowded venues in England. The full details of the plan are yet to be seen, but the rule is set to come into force at the end of September. An NHS Covid Pass - which you can obtain electronically or as a letter - will be used as proof. Mr Raab was asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether the government was in favour of going further and making the vaccine pass compulsory in more settings. ""I think the key principle is in crowded places where we want to open up... whether it's going to a football game or pop concert, we want to make sure people can do that,"" he said. And asked whether they were planning to require students in university halls to get vaccinated, Mr Raab said: ""When we come to the crunch, these decisions will be taken in September. We've got some time to go. ""Right the way through this pandemic we've had to take advice and decisions based on the evidence when we see it. ""We will certainly make sure university students have advance warning, of course we're going to be mindful of this."" He said he had recently visited France, where they had a big surge in vaccinations after bringing in a health pass for many activities. ""It's a little bit of coaxing and cajoling and also making clear that ultimately over September when we know we'll see, as a result of coming out of the lockdown step four, an increase in cases, we can control that with backstop safeguard measures."" Latest government figures show that more than 71% of adults have now had two jabs, while 88% have had a first dose. Young people who are within three months of turning 18 - meaning those who are soon able to go to university - and those aged 12-17 who live with people who have a suppressed immune system, can now also get a jab.  'Appalling' The idea to make vaccines compulsory for university students - either to attend lectures or to live in halls of residence - was not ruled out by either education minister Vicky Ford or Downing Street when asked about it earlier this week. ""We are still looking at the scope for vaccination certifications,"" a No 10 spokesman said on Monday. It is not clear if any rule, if it happens, would apply just to England or be adopted by the whole of the UK - the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of their own coronavirus rules and education is devolved. Earlier this week, the trade union for academic staff such as lecturers, criticised the idea following news reports. ""Students should be prioritised for vaccinations, to ensure as many as possible have the opportunity to be vaccinated by September,"" said the University and College Union. ""But making vaccinations compulsory as a condition to access their education is wrong and would be hugely discriminatory against those who are unable to be vaccinated, and international students."" The National Union of Students also called the idea ""appalling"", saying there has been ""no consultation whatsoever with the sector"".  ""All the students I speak with are incredibly eager to get their vaccinations - if anything they would like them bringing forwards so that they've had both doses before term begins,"" said president Larissa Kennedy. She accused the government of ""lining students up as scapegoats"", describing it as ""finger pointing nonsense"". Both Labour and leading universities have called for vaccination centres to be set up on campuses so that students are jabbed before the winter. The Russell Group - made up of the UK's top universities - has offered its own spaces and facilities to be used as pop-up centres. Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

10," All you need to know about everything that matters. Does UK border relaxation risk spread of new Covid variants? Ministers insist new quarantine-free rules for US and EU travellers are safe Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images Allowing US and EU tourists into the UK without quarantine will leave the country vulnerable to new Delta-like Covid variants, Labour has warned. The government yesterday announced plans to relax self-isolation rules from 4am on 2 August for fully vaccinated travellers arriving from North America and the whole of the bloc with the exception of France. But while the border relaxation has been welcomed by the travel industry, shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon is demanding that Downing Street show evidence that the move will not lead to another new coronavirus variant running “rampant through the country” and damaging “the effort of the British public”. The i news site’s Hugo Gye has also voiced reservations, arguing that “international travel is the single biggest source of danger when it comes to fending off the nightmare scenario of a fourth lockdown”.  “Few countries sequence anything like as many coronavirus infections as the UK: if we are truly unlucky, a new, vaccine-resistant variant could slip through the national defences before it has even been identified,” Gye writes.  The decision was made by cabinet ministers on the Covid-19 Operations (Covid-O) Committee, “in defiance” of warnings from senior officials that the move posed a “clear public health risk”, especially as some travellers will have had coronavirus vaccines that are not approved in the UK, reports The Times. Under the new rules, passengers who have received jabs authorised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be allowed through the border without having to quarantine. The approved vaccines do not include the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine used in Hungary, but The Times says “more than a million” people in the EU member country who have had the jab have been issued with a valid EU travel pass. Although Sinopharm-vaccinated arrivals will still be expected to self-isolate in the UK, “there are concerns that airlines may fail to check the specific vaccine listed on the travel pass”, the paper continues. And “there are also concerns that paper vaccine certificates issued in the United States could be falsified”.  Professor Christina Pagel, director of the clinical operational research unit at University College London, told The Guardian: “We should be taking advantage of the fact that we are an island and having much more control over potential new variants coming in.” Given that even the fully vaccinated can catch and pass on the virus, “a variant that emerges anywhere will spread everywhere”, she added. But fellow expert Professor Ravi Gupta, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Cambridge, told the paper that there were “much more worrying conditions here in the UK” for variants that could escape existing vaccines. This view is shared by Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, who argues that the UK has recently “been more of a risk to others than they have been to us” - and that travel restrictions would only delay, rather than prevent, the arrival of a new variant. Even Australia, which has imposed border closures and mandatory hotel quarantines, has seen its strong Covid defences breached by the Delta variant. In an article for USA Today earlier this year, microbiologist Alex Berezow and chemist Josh Bloom went as far as arguing that border closures were a “distraction” from better methods of disease control such as vaccination, masks and social distancing. Evolutionary pressure that pushes microbes to become more contagious “happens everywhere”, the two experts wrote, so even if a variant such as Delta can be prevented from entering a country, “a more infectious variant of coronavirus will almost certainly evolve there on its own”. As the various theories are put to the test in countries worldwide, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has insisted that opening up the UK border is safe.  Announcing the rule change last night, he said: “We will of course continue to be guided by the latest scientific data, but thanks to our world-leading domestic vaccination programme, we’re able to look to the future and start to rebuild key transatlantic routes with the US while further cementing ties with our European neighbours.”  The Week is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

11," This south London borough has the highest Covid infection rate in London Wandsworth has highest Covid infection rate in London 
  Wandsworth remains the borough with the highest infection rate in London.
 
  The borough’s infection rate currently stands at 553 per 100,000 of the population, with Lambeth second – according to government figures from the week ending July 22.
 
  Residents in the borough are out of ideas on how infections can be reduced now all lockdown restrictions have eased with some fearing another lockdown is looming, but health bosses are urging people to get vaccinated.
 
  The Local Democracy Reporting Service spoke to residents across Wandsworth to find out why infections are so high and what should be done to reduce this.
 
  Faiza North, a resident of Wandsworth who has not been jabbed and does not intend do, called it “just money-making”.
 
Tyler Hislop, 37, is still wearing a mask 
 
  Faiza believes the high numbers are due to the younger population in Wandsworth but does not agree with the way everyone was let out from lockdown on July 19.
 
  The 23-year-old said: “I feel like there’s another lockdown coming. I don’t feel like it’s going to get any better with the way [the government are] going about things, and after Boris extended lockdown for a month, he only extended it because he saw the numbers, but the numbers didn’t get any better.”
 
  Her thoughts on mask-wearing were: “I don’t really think it’s saving us”.
 
  James Sa, a 42-year-old resident of Wandsworth, said: “Mask wearing is a current solution, but not forever.”
 
  He added: “The vaccine reduces the effect of Covid, but doesn’t mitigate the problems.”
 
  Tyler Hislop, 37, who is moving to Wandsworth from Southwark said: “Somebody is going to have the highest [infection rate], but I don’t think there is anything in particular Wandsworth could do to lower it.”
 
  When asked on his opinion of mask-wearing, he said: “I’m going with what the government suggests, which is that they do something, but I’m surprised how little we know about face masks.”
 
  On vaccines, he said: “I’m relying on the experts, and the consensus seems to be that they are good, that they are effective and the research would back that up so I think people should be educated on it.”
 
  As of July 23, at St Geoge’s Hospital in Tooting, there were four Covid-19 positive patients are being cared for in intensive care and 12 on other wards, according to the trust.
 
  This is down from 20 coronavirus patients at the hospital, with two on ventilators on July 13.
 
  A St George’s Hospital spokesperson said: “We have robust plans in place to manage increases in coronavirus admissions, but people can help us and play their part in keeping themselves and others safe by getting their Covid-19 vaccine as soon as possible.
 
  “Lifting restrictions does not mean the risks from Covid-19 have disappeared, but simple steps such as wearing a face mask in crowded or enclosed spaces, washing your hands regularly and keeping a safe distance away from others remain vitally important.”
 
  Shannon Katiyo, director of public health for Wandsworth, said: “The rate of new cases of Covid-19 in Wandsworth has continued to rise reflecting the increase seen elsewhere in London.
 
  “Wandsworth has a very young population and a large proportion of our residents are aged 25-34 years.
 
  “The highest rates of infections also affect the same age group, and we need as many people as possible to get vaccinated.”
 
  He added:  “We know that vaccinations reduce infections, hospitalisations and death and that no one is safe until we are all safe. We are urging everyone to join the millions who have already been vaccinated and grab a jab.”

12," Stockton Covid vaccines nearing expiry as young people spurn jabs Some supplies of coronavirus vaccinations on Teesside are nearing their expiry date as young people cannot be persuaded ""to come through the door"", a health chief has warned. Although overall uptake in Stockton is higher than the North East average, a surplus of jabs is building. Fiona Adamson, of the Hartlepool and Stockton Health GP Federation, said a number of approaches had been tried to encourage young people to come forward. However, none had proved successful. ""The issue has come full circle and we cannot shift the vaccines that are going to expire,"" Mrs Adamson told a meeting of Stockton Council's health and wellbeing board. ""That's not for want of trying. ""We just cannot get the young people to come through the door no matter what we try - and we're trying all sorts of things."" 'Slightly suspicious' A five-week package of additional support is now available to Stockton, along with the rest of the North East, as part of a government effort to cut the Covid-19 transmission rate. It is hoped it will boost vaccine uptake in the region with more walk-in centres and a focus on younger men, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Cautiously welcoming a fall in the local infection rate over the past week, Sarah Bowman-Abouna, Stockton's director of public health, told the meeting the full impact of the easing of restrictions on 19 July had not yet been seen. She added experts had expected the fall in rates to be more gradual which had made teams ""slightly suspicious"" that people were now testing less often than previously.

13," Covid case rate falls for eighth consecutive day The Covid-19 case rate in Wales has fallen for an eighth consecutive day. Thursday's Public Health Wales (PHW) figures show 155.2 people per 100,000 population have tested positive in the past seven days.  The decrease reflects the drop in Covid infections in younger people over the past week. Higher case rates among the under-25s were driving the rising rates seen in most of north Wales and parts of south Wales since the start of June. The figures also show 18 of Wales' 22 local authority areas are seeing a drop in case rates among the under-25 population. Cases among that age drop have been rising in Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Newport and Merthyr Tydfil, but those increases have been small. The highest case rate for under-25s remains in Denbighshire, but it has come down to 751.1 cases per 100,000 - 201 cases in the most recent week. In Denbighshire under-25s account for 46% of positive tests, compared with 60% last week. In the previous week, 15 council areas saw a rise in case rates among under-25s, with the biggest increases in Denbighshire and Conwy. The biggest proportionate fall has been in Monmouthshire though, followed by neighbouring Torfaen. Under-30s currently account for 52% of all positive Covid results.  On average there are now 699 cases a day, compared with 854 positive results a day the week before. Meanwhile, PHW reported three more deaths on Thursday - these occurred in Cardiff and Vale, Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Hywel Dda health board areas on Monday, last Saturday and a week ago on 22 July. There have been nine deaths over the past seven days. Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:

 Festival-goers have reported testing positive for Covid-19 after heading to Latitude. The Henham Park festival, attended by 40,000 people, went ahead at full capacity between July 22 and 25 as part of the latest phase of the government's event research programme. Attendees needed a negative lateral flow test or proof they'd been double-jabbed. But despite precautions, some have since reported positive PCR tests since the festival wrapped up on Sunday. The organisers have been approached for comment.

 A spokesman for the Department for Media, Culture and Sport said it was too soon to say what impact the festival would have on local case numbers. ""The findings are still being looked at and researched, and will be published in due course"", he said. Waveney MP Peter Aldous, who lives near Henham Park, said he had heard from a concerned constituent that Covid-19 protocols weren't being adhered to at the event. Most Read He said: ""The constituent told me that while they were at Latitude they did not think proper safety protocols were being followed. I have took note of those concerns and passed them onto government. ""As a resident of the local area, I think it's fair to say there was some apprehension about a spike in cases. But it's a balancing act. ""There was certainly a desire to get back to normal, and people were incredibly enthusiastic about it."" Suffolk County Council spokeswoman said no official ""outbreak"" had been declared at the county-level.

 Thérèse Coffey, MP for Suffolk Coastal, said: ""Due to the strength of the vaccine programme, it's great we're in a position where Latitude was able to go ahead. ""I'm glad it did, not least because organisers pushed up vaccine uptake by offering jabs to festival goers on-site. ""I don't predict a local spike which can be attributed to Latitude, as most festival goers stay on site."" One Latitude attendee, who did not want to be named, said fellow revellers she knew had tested positive since Sunday. She said: ""It was easy to think Covid no longer existed once you were in that bubble. ""I felt safe because I knew people needed lateral flow tests and two shots of the jab, but upon entry the organisers really weren't that strict about it.

16," COVID-19: Sewage surveillance reveals 'widespread increase' of coronavirus in England last month People shed fragments of coronavirus through daily activities like going to the toilet and blowing their nose, and these subsequently show up in the surveillance of wastewater at sites throughout England. 
          News reporter
              @samuelosborne93
 Thursday 29 July 2021 23:36, UK Sewage monitoring has shown there was a ""widespread increase"" in the concentration of COVID-19 in England throughout June. Samples of wastewater taken from around 270 sewage treatment works were tested for fragments of coronavirus. Live COVID updates from UK and around the world People shed fragments of the virus through daily activities such as going to the loo or blowing their nose, which then enter the sewer system through sinks, drains and toilets. The increase in the concentration of COVID in wastewater was ""indicative of increasing prevalence"", according to a report by the Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection (EMHP) wastewater surveillance programme. The increase was not consistent across all monitoring sites, with some areas showing an overall decrease. ""Generally, the more people with COVID-19 in the community the more viral RNA (ribonucleic acid) will be shed into wastewater,"" the report says. ""Therefore, the concentration in wastewater is indicative of the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community.""

                 The programme helps identify where the virus is circulating in England and can detect spikes in prevalence and the presence of variants. It can also detect the virus even if people don't have symptoms and haven't been tested. Genomic sequencing of wastewater samples can ""provide an indication of where VOCs (variants of concern) and VUIs (variants under investigation) may be present across England"", the report said. It added: ""This is done through genomic sequencing of wastewater samples, to provide an indication of where VOCs and VUIs may be present across England. ""Insights from wastewater monitoring are shared with local and national decision makers, to help inform the action that they can take to stop further transmission."" Taken with other testing programmes, the programme says it can ""help protect against the threat of new variants"". ""Wastewater monitoring complements other testing programmes and public health actions to help protect against the threat of new variants, as the country closely follows the roadmap out of national restrictions,"" the report says. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It comes as the UK recorded 27,734 new coronavirus cases and 91 more deaths on Wednesday, the first rise in cases after seven consecutive days of falling numbers. Despite the rise in cases, the seven-day average was 36.1% down from the previous week. Meanwhile, the latest Office for National Statistics survey has suggested people who catch coronavirus a second time have a lower viral load than the first time, indicating they will have milder symptoms. The survey also suggested one in four young adults who test positive for COVID are no longer following the rules for self-isolating.

17," To beat Covid, there’s a simple lesson – no one’s safe until everyone’s safe We’re falling desperately behind in the fight to get vaccines to all, as only 3% of people in countries that rely on Covax are protected The world is witnessing the emergence of more infectious variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, but a stuttering race to ensure equitable access to vaccines has seen a handful of countries streak ahead, immunising their own populations, leaving many of the world’s vulnerable people in their wake. Communities are struggling with impatience and fatigue, which is understandable. However, easing basic public health measures such as wearing masks and social distancing risks fuelling transmission. In combination with more infectious variants and the “me first” attitude of some countries, people who are unvaccinated and those who have received only one dose are at increasing risk. The world is at a perilous point and we, the special envoys of the World Health Organization’s director general, are calling for a renewed commitment to a comprehensive approach to defeating this pandemic. We have to accelerate along two tracks – one where governments and vaccine manufacturers support all WHO member states in their efforts to create vaccine manufacturing capacity and vaccinate their most vulnerable populations, and the other where individuals and communities maintain a steely focus on continuing essential public health measures to break transmission chains. The first track requires immediate implementation of reiterated calls by the WHO and its Covax partners on the best use of vaccines. Almost 3bn doses of vaccine have been distributed globally, but only 90m of those have gone through Covax. There are at least 60 countries that rely on Covax for vaccines and those countries have vaccination rates that average less than 3%. The world must implement a strategy at global, regional and national level whereby the most vulnerable people are vaccinated first, rather than leaving health workers, elderly people and those with underlying conditions at risk of severe disease. It also includes supporting the WHO’s call to vaccinate at least 10% of the population of every country by September, and a “drive to December” to vaccinate 40% by the end of 2021. Achieving the September goal means 250 million more people in low- and middle-income countries must be vaccinated in just four months, prioritising all health workers and the most at-risk groups to save lives. Such goals align with the bold call by the WHO, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and the World Bank for $50bn in increased financing to vaccinate 40% of the world’s population by the end of the year and 60% by mid-2022. Such an investment pales in comparison with the trillions of dollars of economic losses and costs connected to the pandemic. The WHO continues working to make safe and effective vaccines and other tools available to the world, from issuing emergency use listings (EULs) for 11 vaccines so far, to launching the access to Covid-19 tools accelerator. This will spur development of and access to solutions needed to diagnose, treat and vaccinate vulnerable people in all countries, and enable developing countries to create their own vaccine manufacturing capacity. Manufacturing and diagnostic capacity, virus sequencing capacity, increased case surveillance and other measures are essential components of controlling this pandemic. Countries with the greatest stocks of vaccines should not hoard them and push to cover their entire populations while other countries do without. It is not even in their best interests, since the intense circulation of the virus in countries with no vaccines increases the possibility of more transmissible and dangerous variants, threatening to make current vaccines less effective. At the same time, the world must not lose sight of the second track which requires that everyone refresh their commitment to protecting themselves and others by recognising the importance of mask-wearing, physical distancing, ventilation and other actions that have been proven to curtail the spread of the virus. Engaging with communities, building trust and empowering people to feel part of the response are the keys to inspiring them to continue, more than a year into the pandemic. The urgent call is to save lives. The world has a moral imperative to do so. Global solidarity is needed more than ever. By actively calling for a two-track approach – of ensuring that the most vulnerable people get vaccinated and adhering to sound public health measures, and by calling out those who could be doing more – the whole world can benefit and save lives. No one is safe until everyone is safe.

18," Only 13% of Covid test centres for critical workers are open, No 10 admits Downing Street says 265 sites out of a targeted 2,000 have been established, amid ‘pingdemic’ fears Only 13% of testing sites for fully vaccinated critical workers to free themselves from isolation are up and running, Downing Street has admitted. In an effort to avoid a major hit to the economy due to hundreds of thousands of people needing to quarantine after being identified as a close contact of a positive Covid case, the government set a target of establishing 2,000 sites where critical workers could get tested daily instead of having to isolate. With the advice to isolate if “pinged” or contacted by test and trace set to fall away after 16 August, ministers heralded the scheme as a way of avoiding further disruption to services including public transport, bin collections and food supply. No 10 said on Thursday that just 265 testing sites had been established, with a further 800 due to open within the next week – but gave no specific date for when the approximately 1,000 centres remaining would follow suit, raising concerns about whether people would still be unnecessarily forced into isolation. Statistics released on Thursday showed a record 689,313 people in England and Wales were contacted by the NHS Covid app and asked to self-isolate in the week to 12 July, underlining the widespread disruption caused by surging case rates. Official data from the app showed an 11.4% increase in the number of people “pinged” over the previous week. Separate figures published by NHS test and trace showed that 597,260 people in England were identified as coming into close contact with someone who had tested positive in the same week – the highest since January when England was in lockdown. Ministers have been scrambling to set up the testing sites at workplaces and named which groups of critical workers in certain sectors could be released from quarantine to try to minimise the impact of the “pingdemic”. With many sectors suffering shortages of staff, business groups and Tory backbenchers had been urging the government to bring forward the 16 August date on which adults who have received two vaccine doses can take a test instead of quarantining. At that point children will also be exempt from the requirement to quarantine if they are identified as close contacts. But the prime minister said on Wednesday that date was now “nailed on” and Downing Street said it was clear there would be no earlier change. When the change happens, both adults and children will be advised to take PCR tests. If the result is negative, they can go about their lives as normal. While the contact-testing centres only offer quick-turnaround lateral flow tests, the government said these would still be useful for those critical workers who had not had both vaccines and were identified as a close contact of a positive Covid case, letting them use the tests to be released from their advised isolation. Johnson’s spokesperson rejected a suggestion by Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, who said he would have replaced the isolation programme for close contacts with a test-to-release system from January this year. Downing Street said isolation and testing were both important measures to break chains of transmission of the virus. Johnson’s spokesperson also said he “sympathises” with companies whose workers were being forced to isolate, and appreciated the impact it was having on the economy. However, he suggested that pleas for more employees to be included on the critical workers list would not be taken up. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders had urged the government to exempt those working in carmaking, after the number of vehicles built plummeted to its lowest level since 1953 – barring 2020 – something it blamed on the “pingdemic”. The latest quarantine data covers a period before a recent run of decline in new Covid cases, with new positive tests almost halving. Downing Street will be watching the evolution of new cases closely over the coming days, with hopes rising that the third wave may be starting to peak. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said on Wednesday that “no one really knows” how the pandemic would progress from here. “The truth is, when it comes to case numbers no one really knows where they are going to go next,” he said. “I hope that the falls that we’re seeing now are sustained. That’s of course what I want to see. But we’ve already seen with the Delta variant, a new variant that emerged over the last year that’s more infectious than the previous one, that things can change.” Javid and Johnson were widely criticised for pressing ahead with the 19 July reopening, with almost all restrictions lifted, in the face of surging cases. Both were in self-isolation themselves, Javid with confirmed Covid, on the day.

20," Main Menu News CORONAVIRUS Politics Entertainment Life Shopping Parents Pride From Our Partners Follow us The Main Covid Symptoms May Differ If You're Already Vaccinated Life Reporter People who have been vaccinated for Covid-19 and go on to contract the virus are reporting some different symptoms to people who are unvaccinated. The NHS website still lists the three most common Covid-19 symptoms as a new persistent cough, a high temperature, and a loss of taste and smell – although symptoms of the dominant Delta variant often vary from these.  Now, experts warn that symptoms can differ again in vaccinated people. There are four key symptoms that people with a breakthrough case of Covid after vaccination are reporting, according to the Zoe Symptom Tracker app. Sneezing is one of these. Previously, this wasn’t a common symptom of the virus and was actually a suggested way for people to differentiate between coronavirus and a common cold or allergies. However, if you’ve had the jab and are sneezing more than usual, it could actually be a sign of Covid rather than hay-fever, so it’s worth taking a test. Related... “Interestingly, our data shows that people who had been vaccinated and then tested positive for Covid-19 were more likely to report sneezing as a symptom compared with those without a jab,” say researchers who analysed the data. “This suggests that sneezing a lot with no explanation after you’ve been vaccinated could be a sign of Covid-19.” Additionally, a headache, runny nose and sore throat are also reported as key symptoms of breakthrough Covid cases in people who have been jabbed. The latest symptom data comes from 2,278 vaccinated adults who tested positive with Covid and logged their signs into the Zoe Symptom Tracker app. Researchers looked at the data and compared it to jabbed adults who have tested negative and unvaccinated adults who tested positive. However, they did not reveal whether this data referred to fully-vaccinated Brits or people who have received just one dose. Sneezing is also a key way that viruses spread, the researchers noted, so if you’ve found yourself sneezing more than usual, as well as getting tested, consider taking extra precautions to protect others. “Try to cover all coughs and sneezes with tissue or the inside of your elbow to minimise the spread of droplets. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth until you wash your hands,” they said. In total, there are 20 possible symptoms of Covid, so people should stay alert and if you think you have Covid, always get tested and self-isolate. “Whether you’ve had both Covid jabs or not, we all still need to be careful to follow the advice on ‘hands, face, space, fresh air’ to protect your own health as well as those around you in your family, workplace, and community,” researchers said.

Breakthrough cases among the centre’s vaccinated health-care workers were rare in the first months of 2021.Credit: Jack Guez/AFP via Getty People fully vaccinated against COVID-19 are less likely to become infected with the coronavirus if they have relatively high levels of virus-blocking antibodies, according to a study of thousands of health-care workers who received the Pfizer–BioNTech jab1. The analysis adds to a growing body of evidence that a person’s levels of ‘neutralizing’ antibodies, which block SARS-CoV-2 from infecting cells, predict whether that person will become infected. A robust predictive marker, known as a correlate of protection, could help regulators to approve new vaccines without requiring large clinical trials. It could also help them to assess the need for booster shots to guard against emerging viral variants. The study “is an important step in further validating the use of neutralization titre as a correlate of protection”, says Miles Davenport, an immunologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. When SARS-CoV-2 breaks through The study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine on 28 July, draws on data from almost 11,500 fully vaccinated health-care workers at Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv, Israel. Extensive testing between late January and late April 2021 identified 39 workers who had become infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite being fully vaccinated. All had mild symptoms or none at all, but 19% still had some symptoms 6 weeks after diagnosis. For 22 of the 39 workers with ‘breakthrough’ infections, the authors were able to obtain antibody measurements taken either on the day the infections were detected or in the week before. The researchers also examined data from 104 fully vaccinated workers who matched infected workers for factors such as age but who did not get infected. Comparison showed that levels of neutralizing antibodies were lower among those who got infected — providing the first direct evidence of this effect, says Davenport.
  Six months of COVID vaccines: what 1.7 billion doses have taught scientists The results bolster earlier data collected during clinical trials of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine. Analysis of those data also showed a link between higher levels of neutralizing antibodies and a lower likelihood of breakthrough infection2. But the difference in antibody levels between trial participants who had breakthrough infections and those who didn’t was not statistically significant. The latest study does have drawbacks. It is based on a small number of cases among young and healthy adults, which limits its application, says Andrew Fiore-Gartland, a biostatistician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. More studies from vaccine trials are expected soon, he says. And the analysis does not provide a specific level of antibodies that is associated with protection, say researchers. Such a threshold of protection “is what the field really needs to move forward”, says Fiore-Gartland. doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-02096-3 References Bergwerk, M. et al. N. Engl. J.

The wording on the NHS Covid app has been changed to include a “domestic” section, which tells people they may need to show the pass “at places that have chosen to use the service”. The Liberal Democrats expressed outrage at the move – claiming the government had introduced a new form of Covid certification onto the nation’s phones without seeking MPs consent. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey has called on Mr Johnson to recall parliament so MPs can debate the issue. In a letter to the prime minister, Sir Ed accused him of introducing “Covid ID cards onto the nation’s phones by stealth – without even a whisper from ministers or any scrutiny in parliament”. Previously, NHS Covid app users were given the choice of using it to show their vaccination status for foreign travel, or at one of the government’s pilot sporting events. But the government said it wants to bring in compulsory Covid vaccination certification for nightclubs and other large, crowded venues by the end of September. Mr Johnson has said proof of double-vaccination will be required at such venues – but promised MPs a vote on any changes that would make the vaccine certification mandatory. The Lib Dems and a group of around 40 backbench Tory MPs remain firmly opposed to any push towards vaccine passport use in shops, restaurants, nightclubs and any other domestic setting. Dozens of Tory, Lib Dem and several Labour MPs have signed a Big Brother Watch declaration against denying individuals “access to general services, businesses or jobs”. Hospitality industry chiefs also remained opposed. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said earlier this week that he is ready to support “passports plus testing” to enable mass-attendance events to admit large audiences – but said he would rule out vaccine passport checks to access healthcare or food shops. Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: “The Conservatives are no strangers to a U-turn, they should have no problem with doing the right thing and scrapping vaccine passports for good. “At least when Tony Blair tried to introduce ID cards he put a bill to parliament, this lot won’t even open up parliament to debate it. They must recall parliament now if they are serious about this.” The Lib Dem MP added: “To get your vaccine passport, you have to type and click through a bunch of options. Just think of the faff getting into hospitality businesses, who don’t want it and can’t afford to pay staff to police it.” Foreign secretary Dominic Raab suggested earlier on Thursday that vaccine passports were a way of “coaxing and cajoling” more people into getting their jabs. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I was in France earlier this week. We’ve seen when they signalled in various different areas that you would need double vaccination in order to proceed in one or other area you got a big surge of people getting the double vaccinations.” Mr Raab also suggested it was a “smart policy” for employers to ensure their staff have been double jabbed before returning to the office. “Whether or not there should be legal rules, I think we need to look at carefully,” he told Sky News.

23," AstraZeneca sales of Covid vaccine triple to $1.2bn in first half of 2021 Not-for-profit pledge sees British firm’s sales revenue fall significantly short of US rival Pfizer AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine has brought in $1.2bn (£900m) in the first half of this year, with sales tripling in the second quarter from the first – but its earnings remained significantly below those of its US rival Pfizer.  Britain’s biggest drugmaker revealed that it had generated $894m from Covid-19 vaccine sales in the three months to the end of June, following $275m in the first three months of the year. It has pledged to provide the jab, which it developed with Oxford University, on a not-for-profit basis during this pandemic. The figures came a day after Pfizer said it made $7.8bn from the Covid jab it developed with Germany’s BioNTech in the second quarter, more than doubling its first-quarter takings of $3.5bn. It raised its 2021 sales forecast for the vaccine to $33.5bn from $26bn, as the Delta variant spreads rapidly and scientists debate whether people will need booster shots. Pfizer and BioNTech have tweaked their mRNA vaccine to target the Delta variant and will begin testing the modified jab on humans next month. Moderna will reveal next Thursday how much it made from its coronavirus jab between April and June. The US drugs company brought in $1.7bn from sales of its Covid vaccine between January and March, helping it to its first quarterly profit since its foundation in 2010. In May, the firm forecast revenues of $19.2bn from the vaccine this year, but that estimate could rise next week. GlaxoSmithKline posted £276m of Covid-19 sales on Wednesday, mainly from sales of its adjuvant – which boosts the efficacy of vaccines – to other drug makers. The UK’s second biggest pharmaceutical firm has not developed its own coronavirus shot, but is working with France’s Sanofi and Germany’s CureVac on new vaccines. AstraZeneca said about $572m of vaccine sales came from Europe during the first half of 2021, in a period when the company was embroiled in a court battle with the European Commission over delivery delays, and a further $455m from emerging markets. The firm’s overall revenues grew 23% to $15.5bn in the first half of the year, boosted by new medicines, beating analysts’ expectations. Excluding Covid-19 vaccine sales, revenues were up 14% to nearly $14.4bn. Profit before tax rose by 25% to $2.4bn. The company upped its sales and profit forecasts for this year after the $39bn acquisition of Alexon, a US firm that specialises in drugs for rare diseases. AstraZeneca has postponed its application to US regulators for approval of the vaccine to the second half of this year. Chief executive Pascal Soriot said: “The simple answer is, it’s an important vaccine. And we believe it may play a role in the future, so we want to file and get approval for it.” The filing has been delayed because the US Food and Drug Administration has requested large data sets, including from the rollout in the UK and elsewhere. AstraZeneca is also testing booster jabs for people who have already been vaccinated with two doses of either its own shot or the mRNA-based vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna. As well as supply delays, AstraZeneca has been linked to a small but concerning number of cases of blood clots, some of them fatal. A new study from researchers in Spain, the UK and the Netherlands found that patients developed blood clots after receiving the vaccine at a “similar”, very low rate to those who had received the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. “In this study including 1,372,213 people vaccinated against Sars-CoV-2, similar safety profiles were seen for both vaccines,” the researchers wrote in their pre-print paper, which is due to be published in the Lancet medical journal. It has not been peer-reviewed yet.

24," Covid-19: NI Executive to relax travel isolation rules By Stephen WalkerBBC News NI Political Correspondent People who have been fully vaccinated in the EU or the US will not need to self-isolate when entering Northern Ireland from Monday. This easing of the Covid-19 travel rules is in line with changes made in England, Scotland and Wales. The Northern Ireland Executive also decided to allow international cruises to restart from 31 July. Students arriving from red-list countries will be put into managed isolation facilities. The pilot rollout for the expansion of the amber listed countries vaccinations policy is due to start on Monday 2 August. It means all those coming from the US or from EU countries (except France) will not have to isolate. There was also agreement that Villarreal football fans coming to Belfast for next month's Uefa Super Cup final against Chelsea would not have to self-isolate.  The executive has also agreed the 1m (3ft) social distancing regulation will be applied in indoor settings such as supermarkets and shopping centres from 18:00 BST on Friday 30 July. The 1m rule remains as guidance outdoors. It was also agreed that function rooms and community halls can put on live music from 30 July. Plans to reopen conferences and exhibitions have been delayed - that will be considered in August. A final decision to drop the wearing of masks in schools has also been delayed although earlier this month ministers said the wearing of face coverings may just be regarded as guidance when schools return. Since last August, post-primary pupils and teachers have been required to wear face coverings in school corridors and other communal areas. More discussions will take place between officials the Department of Health and the Department of Education. The proposals to ease restrictions at borders were discussed against a backdrop of increasing coronavirus-related pressures in Northern Ireland's hospitals. On Wednesday, BBC News NI reported that some cancer surgeries in Belfast were being cancelled in order to expand the number of staff caring for Covid-19 patients. The rule change on travel - which will come into force in England, Scotland and Wales from 04:00 on Monday - applies to people who have had both jabs of a vaccine approved by the EU or the US. Travellers will still need to take either a lateral flow or a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test pre-departure and a PCR test on the second day after they arrive. Under-18s will be exempt from isolation and some will not have to test, depending on their age. Travel certificate service resumes The Department of Health confirmed its Covid certification service for people travelling abroad will resume on Friday morning after it was ""temporarily interrupted"" by a technical problem. The interim system allows people from Northern Ireland to prove they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to countries which require it for entry. However, the service went offline on Tuesday, leaving many people concerned about their travel plans. On Thursday, the department said the system would go online again from 09:00 on Friday and should only be used by those travelling on Sunday 1 August ""in the first instance"". With the app still not available, applications can only be made online through the NIdirect website. Applications would be processed manually, the department added, with applicants contacted by email in response. The department said it was resuming the service in a ""controlled and phased way"" and explained that ""further communication"" would be issued on Friday in relation to people travelling after Sunday. Other developments On Thursday, another 1,471 positive coronavirus cases were reported by the Department of Health - down from 1,600 on Tuesday.  That includes samples taken in recent days, not necessarily in the past 24 hours. Two more Covid-19-related deaths were also reported. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride urged people to use the health service wisely. Earlier this week the executive agreed that theatres and concert venues could reopen, after initially delaying its decision. On Monday, as well as agreeing to the reopening of theatres and concert venues, ministers backed further modest changes to the restrictions, including: More on this story Executive agrees theatre and concert reopening No quarantine for fully jabbed EU and US arrivals What can I do as NI's Covid restrictions ease?

Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile  Manchester United have cancelled their pre-season friendly with Preston on Saturday after a number of suspected coronavirus cases in their camp. United were due to travel to Deepdale at the weekend to continue their preparations for the new season, but routine lateral flow testing on Thursday saw some possible positive cases returned. Those people are now isolating, pending further PCR tests. A United statement read: “Maintaining Covid security is a priority for us. Following routine testing of the first-team training group today, we have identified a small number of suspected positive cases. This has led to those people isolating, pending further tests. “As a precautionary measure based on Covid protocols, we have taken the difficult decision that we will not now be able to play the friendly match against Preston North End this Saturday. “We regret the disruption to Preston and disappointment caused to fans. Any Manchester United fans who have purchased tickets for the game will be automatically refunded. “At this stage, we do not expect further disruption around our forthcoming matches, but we will continue to follow Premier League protocols in this regard.” United are due to close their pre-season programme with a game against Everton at Old Trafford on August 7.

26," When is Nicola Sturgeon's next scheduled update to confirm lockdown easing? Covid: When is Nicola Sturgeon's next update to confirm lockdown easing? 
  Nicola Sturgeon is scheduled to give her next update on the easing of Covid restrictions in Scotland next week in Parliament. 
 
  It comes just two weeks after Scotland moved to level 0, the country's lowest level of restrictions. 
 
  Parliament will be recalled for the second time during the summer recess to allow the first minister to outline her plans for August 9, the next planned date for lifting measures. 
 
  This is currently the last date identified in the Government's plan for easing lockdown, when they hope to axe most remaining measures. 
 
  However, the Government has already confirmed that some base measures, including mask wearing, will remain in place.
 
  Here's when the next update will take place?
 
  When is Nicola Sturgeon's next Covid update?
 
  Nicola Sturgeon's next scheduled Covid update will take place in Parliament on  Tuesday August 3 at around 2pm. 
 
  Parliament will be virtually recalled for the update to allow MSPs to scrutinize the Government's proposals for lockdown easing. 
 
  What will Nicola Sturgeon say during the update? 
 
  The first minister is expected to confirm whether the planned axing of remaining restrictions - excluding baseline measures - can go ahead on August 9. 
 
  If these plans go ahead, it means that there would be no more limits on hospitality or the number of people allowed to meet and socialise for the first time in nearly 18 months.
 
  England have already made similar moves, having abandoned all Covid restrictions on July 19, the same day Scotland moved to level 0.  
 
  It is also likely that the first minister will touch on the plans for the return of schools, as well as providing the usual statistics on case rates, hospitalisations, deaths and vaccinations. 
 
  Sturgeon will face questions from MSPs regarding the plans, some of which may have been submitted by their constituents. 
 
  How can I watch the update?
 
  The update will be available to watch on the Scottish Government's social media pages as well as the BBC Scotland.  
 
  The update will also be tweeted live on the SNP's Twitter feed. 
 
  How many cases in my area?
 
  In order to make their decision about August 9, the Scottish Government will be closely monitoring the rates of Covid around the country. 
 
  Here are the numbers in your local area:

27," Covid NI: Executive announcement as new restrictions eased The changes will come into effect from Friday, July 30 Get the latest nostalgia features and photo stories from Belfast Nostalgia straight to your inbox Thank you for subscribing! We have more newsletters The Executive has announced a number of changes to coronavirus restrictions in Northern Ireland. In a statement on Thursday evening, it said that after ""careful consideration of the public health situation and wider societal context"", members of the Executive had agreed a number of changes to the Covid-19 restrictions. From 6pm on Friday, July 30, the following changes will come into effect. Social distancing The Executive noted the health benefits of social distancing, the economic benefits of sectors and venues re-opening, and the societal benefits this brings. The Executive has therefore decided that: The statement added: ""The Executive remains concerned about the spread of the virus and its transmissibility. Therefore, the Executive calls on all venues, customers and attendees to be mindful of this in organising and attending events, and to follow all the public health advice on matters such as hand washing, wearing of face coverings, the benefits of taking lateral flow tests, and the essential need to self-isolate if you have a positive test or are otherwise asked to do so. The virus remains a risk to our health and economic wellbeing and the steps taken today must be seen in that context."" There will be a fuller discussion on August 12. Live music venues Expanding their previous decision, to allow the return of live music in concert halls and theatres, the Executive agreed to include other indoor venues such as function rooms of hotels, or community halls. There will be no restriction to background or ambient levels of volume. Where the venue is a space within larger premises, access to the venue must be effectively controlled and managed and the venue must be sufficiently isolated from the rest of the premises to ensure that the volume of the music in the venue does not breach ambient or background levels in other parts of the premises. Entry to performances for audiences will be by ticket only. Tickets must be purchased in advance of the performance. Audiences for indoor events must have allocated seating and remain seated, dancing will not be permitted and social distancing of 1m will be required. Use of risk reduction measures The use of lateral flow testing for all events is strongly advised as a measure to reduce risk. Social distancing; the use of face coverings; and holding events outdoors where possible, are also advised as mitigating measures. International Travel  From August 2, there will be a pilot roll out of the expansion of the amber vaccinated arrivals policy to include people vaccinated in any of the EU27 (except France); EFTA countries (Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein); and the European microstate countries (Andorra, Monaco, and Vatican City) and the United States.  In relation to arrivals from the United States, it was agreed that the policy approach will be that: only people fully vaccinated with FDA-approved vaccines in the US rollout, who can present a CDC card as proof of vaccination, would be included. A requirement to prove residency in addition to the CDC card for US arrivals was agreed, to mitigate against fraud. From July 31, international cruises will restart in line with the traffic light system, with strong guidance to the sector outlining the need to manage increased risks and maintain risk mitigations (including use of vaccination and testing), alongside continued monitoring of cruise data and clear contingency plans. Measures will be put in place to facilitate alternative managed isolation arrangements for international student arrivals from red list countries from August 9. From August 2, a bespoke testing regime will be implemented, which will apply to NI international arrivals exempt from self-isolation because they are travelling for work. This will only apply to specific types of work as outlined in the regulations. An exemption from self-isolation for Villarreal fans and UEFA VIPs travelling for the Super Cup Final on 11 August will be put in place, with the IFA putting in place a range of mitigations. Recovery Plan The Executive also agreed the Building Forward – Consolidated Covid Recovery Plan that will be published on Thursday. The statement read: ""The purpose of the draft Recovery Plan is to accelerate economic, health and societal recovery in the short term so we can emerge stronger and also to transform and innovate to plan now for longer term ambitions. ""Covid-19 has affected all aspects of our society. Sadly, many people have lost their lives and this has had a devastating impact on families and communities. There has also been profound disruption to people’s lives and livelihoods and a significant impact on people’s physical and mental health and wellbeing. ""The purpose of the draft Recovery Plan is to accelerate economic, health and societal recovery in the short term so we can emerge stronger and also to plan now for longer term transformative and innovative change. ""For the last 18 months, our focus has been on providing an immediate, coordinated response to the Covid 19 pandemic. However, with the easing of coronavirus restrictions, it is timely for the Executive to look to the future and bring together a suite of recovery actions into this new strategy. The virus unfortunately continues to have an impact on our lives and we must not lose sight of that as we go about our daily lives. ""Already existing economic, health and societal challenges were exacerbated as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and this requires immediate action as we begin the transition from crisis mode to recovery. ""We have developed the integrated Recovery Plan to inform our priorities to accelerate recovery over a 24-month period through focused, collaborative working. The Plan details 83 highly impactful interventions that will be progressed over the next 24 months to deliver recovery for all our citizens under four strategic Recovery Accelerators: sustainable economic development; green growth and sustainability; tackling inequalities and health of the population. These work together to ensure that we can emerge stronger from the pandemic. ""We want to see our economy revived, resilient and dynamic. These interventions will help ensure we have an inclusive society where people have equal access to opportunities. The health of the population accelerator will lead to a resilient health sector, with all having access to health and social care in line with targets. We have prioritised green growth and sustainability to reduce our emissions and protect our environment. ""Inequalities that were already present in our society have been made worse over the last 18 months and it is essential these are addressed head on to prevent any further decline. Key to this is strong economic growth to create opportunities for our citizens, improve our lives and to help achieve our green growth and sustainable ambitions. ""As we begin the journey to recovery, we don’t want to lose the positive changes to our ways of working and living that came about as a result of the pandemic. We have seen a beneficial impact on our environment; we have seen a greater use of technology; and we have seen businesses and individuals respond in innovative and imaginative ways. We must continue to build on this. ""The Recovery Plan is not about getting us back to where we were before but rather provides the foundation for renewal. We are looking to do things differently, apply what we have learned in responding to the crisis and ultimately aim to be in a better position than we were before. ""Looking further ahead, it is important that what we deliver through the Recovery Plan will contribute to achieving our longer-term strategic objectives in our developing Programme for Government and commitments under New Decade New Approach.  ""We continue to urge all people who can to get both doses of the vaccine as soon as possible to help protect yourself and others. Information is available at nidirect.gov.uk/covidvaccine as to where you can walk in for a jab or book an appointment.  ""And please continue to follow the public health advice to help keep yourself, and everyone else, safe and help us to continue to make this positive progress.""

28," COVID-19: French minister accuses UK of imposing 'discriminatory' and 'excessive' quarantine rules on citizens Currently, despite being an amber list country, double-jabbed Britons returning from France still have to quarantine for ten days when they arrive back.

 Thursday 29 July 2021 13:45, UK The UK government's decision to keep quarantine measures for travellers coming from France while removing them for all other European countries is ""discriminatory"" and ""excessive"", a French minister has said. On Wednesday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed England would allow fully vaccinated visitors from both the EU and the United States to arrive without needing to quarantine from 2 August. But he added that tougher rules will continue to be in place for France, which, although on the amber list, still requires travellers to quarantine on their return regardless of their vaccine status. Mr Shapps said this advice would be reviewed at ""the end of next week"" as part of an ongoing assessment of travel rules. But French Europe minister Clement Beaune described the move as ""incomprehensible on health grounds"" and accused the UK government of making decisions ""not based on science"". ""It's excessive, and it's frankly incomprehensible on health grounds,"" Mr Beaune told French TV channel LCI. ""It's not based on science and [it's] discriminatory towards the French.""

                 Mr Beaune said the UK government should use ""common sense"" and review the matter ""as quickly as possible"". He added that the French government are not planning to place any increased measures on British citizens ""for now"". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  UK ministers have said quarantine rules are being kept in place for travellers from France because of the prevalence of the Beta variant of coronavirus. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the decision to put France on the amber plus list was ""based on the prevalence of the so-called Beta variant, in particular in the Reunion bit of France"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Reunion is a French island in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar. It is 6,000 miles from Paris. Mr Raab also said ministers ""want to get France up the traffic light system as soon as possible"". But French officials believe the move should be made immediately. Currently, only people who received two vaccines in the UK can avoid quarantine when arriving from amber list countries. The UK government said the rule change would help to reunite family and friends whose loved ones live abroad. But this rule also does not apply to France. Speaking to Kay Burley on Sky News on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government is ""increasingly confident"" that more countries will soon be added to the amber and green travel lists. The foreign secretary said he believes opportunities for international travel can in the near future be opened up further and did not rule out the possibility of popular European holiday destinations moving to different categories in the moving government's traffic light travel system at the next review point a week on Thursday.

29," EU orders promising treatment for severe Covid-19 from UK pharma firm 
The medicine works using laboratory-reproduced antibodies. Early trials have found that it reduces the risk of hospitalisation or death in high-risk patients by 85%
 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is currently evaluating the Covid-19 antibody treatment  Pic: Angellodeco / Shutterstock The European Union has ordered more than 220,000 doses of a promising Covid-19 treatment made by British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline. The treatment is currently being evaluated by the EU. The European Commission told Reuters that the new medication, sotrovimab, is a type of “monoclonal antibody”.  It uses antibodies that have been genetically obtained. They are cloned from the white blood cells of patients who have had a non-severe form of Covid-19. The sotrovimab treatment is also known as VIR-7831 and GSK4182136. It is administered via an intravenous drip. As the EMA explains on its website: “A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that attaches to a specific structure (called an antigen). Sotrovimab is designed to attach to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, limiting the ability of the virus to enter the body’s cells.” French health research institute l’Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale (Inserm) explains: “Monoclonal antibodies are selected for their effectiveness at targeting a specific intrusion, and reproduced in large quantities in a lab to be given to those who need them.” The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is currently evaluating the treatment with a view to obtaining a marketing authorisation. The evaluation began on May 7. In France, the sotrovimab monoclonal antibody treatment has already been successfully used.  In mid-March, France was given temporary authorisation to use the medicine on adults at risk of developing severe forms of the virus. More than 1,000 patients benefited from the treatment, said drug safety agency l’Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament (ANSM). Sotrovimab also received emergency authorisation in the US, for use in high-risk adults and children. Trials showed that it resulted in an 85% reduction in the risks of hospitalisation or death in high-risk adult outpatients compared to a placebo. The EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has already reviewed the drug, and said it can be used to treat confirmed Covid-19 in people aged 12 and over, who do not require supplemental oxygen therapy, and who are at risk of progressing to severe Covid-19. In May, Dr Adrienne E. Shapiro, an infectious disease specialist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and investigator in the medication trial, said: “Monoclonal antibodies such as sotrovimab are potentially one of our most effective tools for fighting Covid-19.  “While preventive measures, including vaccines, can reduce the total number of cases, sotrovimab is an important treatment option for those who become ill with Covid-19 and are at high risk – allowing them to avoid hospitalisation or worse.” Monoclonal antibody technology research was awarded a Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1984. Researchers Niels K. Jerne, Georges J.F. Köhler and César Milstein were recognised “for theories concerning ‘the specificity in development and control of the immune system’ and the discovery of ‘the principle for production of monoclonal antibodies’.” The technology is already used in other forms in France to treat a number of conditions, including cancer, Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and in transplant patients.

30,"  Malaysia’s daily new Covid cases per million people is now one of the highest globally The Covid-19 outbreak in Malaysia has become one of the worst globally. On a seven-day moving average basis, Malaysia recorded 483.72 confirmed Covid infections per million people on Wednesday — the eighth highest globally and top in Asia, according to the latest data compiled by online repository Our World in Data. Meanwhile, the country's daily reported deaths relating to Covid were around 4.90 per million people on Tuesday on a seven-day moving average basis. That's the 19th highest globally and third highest in Asia, the data showed. Our World in Data is a collaboration between researchers at the University of Oxford and U.K. non-profit organization Global Change Data Lab. Malaysia managed to keep the number of infections low for much of 2020. But the country has struggled to tame a surge in cases despite implementing multiple rounds of restrictions and a state of emergency. Political analysts blame the government's mishandling of the outbreak as it worsened. ""Malaysia's response is being hampered by chaotic governance and persistent political infighting,"" Joshua Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at think tank Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a report. Malaysia's political crisis The Southeast Asian country plunged into political turmoil when former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad unexpectedly resigned in February last year. It paved the way for Muhyiddin to form a government by cobbling together a fragile coalition. Political opponents have long challenged Muhyiddin's claim of majority support in the country's 222-seat parliament. Calls for the prime minister's resignation — even among his allies — grew louder after Malaysia's king on Thursday issued a rare rebuke over the government's handling of the state of emergency. The king had consented to Muhyiddin's request for a state of emergency from January to August 1 to manage the country's surging Covid infections. Many analysts considered the move an attempt by the embattled prime minister to preserve his political standing, especially when parliament was suspended under the emergency and elections cannot be held. When parliament reconvened this week, the government surprised the nation by announcing that it had decided to end the emergency effective July 21. The king said the government's unilateral revocation did not follow constitutional procedure. Since coming to power, Muhyiddin has sought to avoid parliamentary votes that his political opponents could use as a proxy to a no-confidence vote against his leadership. The Malaysian parliament has never voted on a no-confidence motion. Covid vaccinations picking up Despite the political tussle, Malaysian authorities have accelerated the pace of vaccinations in recent weeks. More than 18% of the country's 32 million population have been fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data.     Economists from British bank Barclays estimated that Malaysia — along with Singapore and South Korea — will be among the Asian countries to reach ""critical levels"" of vaccinations this year. CNBC Health & Science  Read CNBC's latest global health coverage: The Malaysian government said it aimed to inoculate most of the adult population by year-end. Still, economists said the worsening outbreak and ongoing social-distancing measures have hurt Malaysia's growth outlook. Barclays last month cut its 2021 growth projection from 5.5% to 5%. That's well below the Malaysian central bank's forecast range of 6% to 7.5%. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

31," Two-thirds of hospital patients with Covid not double-jabbed The average age of Covid patients at Salford Royal has fallen Sign up to the MySalford newsletter to keep up with what's happening in and around the city Thank you for subscribing! We have more newsletters Around two-thirds of Covid patients at Salford Royal are not fully vaccinated. Of the 50 Covid patients at the hospital, eight of which are in critical care, between 30 and 35 pc have received both doses of the coronavirus vaccine. The number of people being hospitalised because of Covid has risen, but not at the same speed as the infection rate which is now starting to 'stabilise'.  READ MORE: 'Unprecedented' pressure at hospitals hit by staff shortages and rising demand  In the first wave of the pandemic last year, the average age of Covid patients at Salford Royal Hospital was around 73 years old – now, the average age is 50. More than 70 pc of adults in Salford, and more than 85pc of over-50s, have had their first jab, according to the local clinical commissioning group (CCG). Salford CCG chief accountable officer Steve Dixon said the lower average age of Covid patients in hospital reflects the rollout of the vaccination programme. He said: ""The vaccination programme is effective. ""It doesn't provide a fail-safe and prevent people from being hospitalised. ""Some people still go to hospital even after having been vaccinated and receiving the two jabs. ""But that is a significant lower percentage and evidence of good protection in terms of the severity of the illness after having two vaccines."" There are no neighbourhoods or communities with a particularly low uptake of the vaccine, but there has been more hesitancy within the younger population. Mobile and pop-up vaccination clinics are being deployed to 'mop up' areas with lower uptake, but Dixon said there are no particular places of concern. It comes as the NHS is under 'extreme pressure' in Greater Manchester. More 999 calls means people are waiting longer for an ambulance to arrive, with response times for the least urgent cases taking more than nine hours. A&E attendance is now higher than it was before the coronavirus crisis – and social distancing measures are still in place within emergency departments.

If you want to contact Jo directly, you can email him at joseph.timan@reachplc.com. Meanwhile, the workforce is stretched as many staff are forced to self-isolate. Dixon told the CCG governing body that staff have been doing a 'fantastic' job, but are 'very tired, very stressed and very exhausted' due to the pandemic. He said: ""We've got a very tired, burnt out workforce pulling out all the stops and doing everything that they can. ""But there are fewer people working in our services at the moment trying to treat and care for more patients and more demand. ""That is the reality of the situation.""
